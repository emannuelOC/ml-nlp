with all this stuff going down at the moment with mj i ve started listening to his music watching the odd documentary here and there watched the wiz and watched moonwalker again maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent moonwalker is part biography part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released some of it has subtle messages about mj s feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad m kay visually impressive but of course this is all about michael jackson so unless you remotely like mj in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring some may call mj an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie but mj and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of him the actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for minutes or so excluding the smooth criminal sequence and joe pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord why he wants mj dead so bad is beyond me because mj overheard his plans nah joe pesci s character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno maybe he just hates mj s music lots of cool things in this like mj turning into a car and a robot and the whole speed demon sequence also the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scene bottom line this movie is for people who like mj on one level or another which i think is most people if not then stay away it does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically mj s bestest buddy in this movie is a girl michael jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty well with all the attention i ve gave this subject hmmm well i don t know because people can be different behind closed doors i know this for a fact he is either an extremely nice but stupid guy or one of the most sickest liars i hope he is not the latter the classic war of the worlds by timothy hines is a very entertaining film that obviously goes to great effort and lengths to faithfully recreate h g wells classic book mr hines succeeds in doing so i and those who watched his film with me appreciated the fact that it was not the standard predictable hollywood fare that comes out every year e g the spielberg version with tom cruise that had only the slightest resemblance to the book obviously everyone looks for different things in a movie those who envision themselves as amateur critics look only to criticize everything they can others rate a movie on more important bases like being entertained which is why most people never agree with the critics we enjoyed the effort mr hines put into being faithful to h g wells classic novel and we found it to be very entertaining this made it easy to overlook what the critics perceive to be its shortcomings the film starts with a manager nicholas bell giving welcome investors robert carradine to primal park a secret project mutating a primal animal using fossilized dna like jurassik park and some scientists resurrect one of nature s most fearsome predators the sabretooth tiger or smilodon scientific ambition turns deadly however and when the high voltage fence is opened the creature escape and begins savagely stalking its prey the human visitors tourists and scientific meanwhile some youngsters enter in the restricted area of the security center and are attacked by a pack of large pre historical animals which are deadlier and bigger in addition a security agent stacy haiduk and her mate brian wimmer fight hardly against the carnivorous smilodons the sabretooths themselves of course are the real star stars and they are astounding terrifyingly though not convincing the giant animals savagely are stalking its prey and the group run afoul and fight against one nature s most fearsome predators furthermore a third sabretooth more dangerous and slow stalks its victims the movie delivers the goods with lots of blood and gore as beheading hair raising chills full of scares when the sabretooths appear with mediocre special effects the story provides exciting and stirring entertainment but it results to be quite boring the giant animals are majority made by computer generator and seem totally lousy middling performances though the players reacting appropriately to becoming food actors give vigorously physical performances dodging the beasts running bound and leaps or dangling over walls and it packs a ridiculous final deadly scene no for small kids by realistic gory and violent attack scenes other films about sabretooths or smilodon are the following sabretooth by james r hickox with vanessa angel david keith and john rhys davies and the much better bc by roland emmerich with with steven strait cliff curtis and camilla belle this motion picture filled with bloody moments is badly directed by george miller and with no originality because takes too many elements from previous films miller is an australian director usually working for television tidal wave journey to the center of the earth and many others and occasionally for cinema the man from snowy river zeus and roxanne robinson crusoe rating below average bottom of barrel it must be assumed that those who praised this film the greatest filmed opera ever didn t i read somewhere either don t care for opera don t care for wagner or don t care about anything except their desire to appear cultured either as a representation of wagner s swan song or as a movie this strikes me as an unmitigated disaster with a leaden reading of the score matched to a tricksy lugubrious realisation of the text it s questionable that people with ideas as to what an opera or for that matter a play especially one by shakespeare is about should be allowed anywhere near a theatre or film studio syberberg very fashionably but without the smallest justification from wagner s text decided that parsifal is about bisexual integration so that the title character in the latter stages transmutes into a kind of beatnik babe though one who continues to sing high tenor few if any of the actors in the film are the singers and we get a double dose of armin jordan the conductor who is seen as the face but not heard as the voice of amfortas and also appears monstrously in double exposure as a kind of batonzilla or conductor who ate monsalvat during the playing of the good friday music in which by the way the transcendant loveliness of nature is represented by a scattering of shopworn and flaccid crocuses stuck in ill laid turf an expedient which baffles me in the theatre we sometimes have to piece out such imperfections with our thoughts but i can t think why syberberg couldn t splice in for parsifal and gurnemanz mountain pasture as lush as was provided for julie andrews in sound of music the sound is hard to endure the high voices and the trumpets in particular possessing an aural glare that adds another sort of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired conducting and paralytic unfolding of the ritual someone in another review mentioned the bayreuth recording and knappertsbusch though his tempi are often very slow had what jordan altogether lacks a sense of pulse a feeling for the ebb and flow of the music and after half a century the orchestral sound in that set in modern pressings is still superior to this film superbly trashy and wondrously unpretentious s exploitation hooray the pre credits opening sequences somewhat give the false impression that we re dealing with a serious and harrowing drama but you need not fear because barely ten minutes later we re up until our necks in nonsensical chainsaw battles rough fist fights lurid dialogs and gratuitous nudity bo and ingrid are two orphaned siblings with an unusually close and even slightly perverted relationship can you imagine playfully ripping off the towel that covers your sister s naked body and then stare at her unshaven genitals for several whole minutes well bo does that to his sister and judging by her dubbed laughter she doesn t mind at all sick dude anyway as kids they fled from russia with their parents but nasty soldiers brutally slaughtered mommy and daddy a friendly smuggler took custody over them however and even raised and trained bo and ingrid into expert smugglers when the actual plot lifts off years later they re facing their ultimate quest as the mythical and incredibly valuable white fire diamond is coincidentally found in a mine very few things in life ever made as little sense as the plot and narrative structure of white fire but it sure is a lot of fun to watch most of the time you have no clue who s beating up who or for what cause and i bet the actors understood even less but whatever the violence is magnificently grotesque and every single plot twist is pleasingly retarded the script goes totally bonkers beyond repair when suddenly and i won t reveal for what reason bo needs a replacement for ingrid and fred williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his sleazy black fingers all over the local prostitutes bo s principal opponent is an italian chick with big breasts but a hideous accent the preposterous but catchy theme song plays at least a dozen times throughout the film there s the obligatory we re falling in love montage and loads of other attractions my god what a brilliant experience the original french title translates itself as life to survive which is uniquely appropriate because it makes just as much sense as the rest of the movie none i dont know why people think this is such a bad movie its got a pretty good plot some good action and the change of location for harry does not hurt either sure some of its offensive and gratuitous but this is not the only movie like that eastwood is in good form as dirty harry and i liked pat hingle in this movie as the small town cop if you liked dirty harry then you should see this one its a lot better than the dead pool this movie could have been very good but comes up way short cheesy special effects and so so acting i could have looked past that if the story wasn t so lousy if there was more of a background story it would have been better the plot centers around an evil druid witch who is linked to this woman who gets migraines the movie drags on and on and never clearly explains anything it just keeps plodding on christopher walken has a part but it is completely senseless as is most of the movie this movie had potential but it looks like some really bad made for tv movie i would avoid this movie i watched this video at a friend s house i m glad i did not waste money buying this one the video cover has a scene from the movie capricorn one the movie starts out with several clips of rocket blow ups most not related to manned flight sibrel s smoking gun is a short video clip of the astronauts preparing a video broadcast he edits in his own voice over instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say the video curiously ends with a showing of the zapruder film his claims about radiation shielding star photography and others lead me to believe is he extremely ignorant or has some sort of ax to grind against nasa the astronauts or american in general his science is bad and so is this video a friend of mine bought this film for and even then it was grossly overpriced despite featuring big names such as adam sandler billy bob thornton and the incredibly talented burt young this film was about as funny as taking a chisel and hammering it straight through your earhole it uses tired bottom of the barrel comedic techniques consistently breaking the fourth wall as sandler talks to the audience and seemingly pointless montages of hot girls adam sandler plays a waiter on a cruise ship who wants to make it as a successful comedian in order to become successful with women when the ship s resident comedian the shamelessly named dickie due to his unfathomable success with the opposite gender is presumed lost at sea sandler s character shecker gets his big break dickie is not dead he s rather locked in the bathroom presumably sea sick perhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time this movie is full of references like mad max ii the wild one and many others the ladybug s face it s a clear reference or tribute to peter lorre this movie is a masterpiece we ll talk much more about in the future what happens when an army of wetbacks towelheads and godless eastern european commies gather their forces south of the border gary busey kicks their butts of course another laughable example of reagan era cultural fallout bulletproof wastes a decent supporting cast headed by l q jones and thalmus rasulala although i generally do not like remakes believing that remakes are waste of time this film is an exception i didn t actually know so far until reading the previous comment that this was a remake so my opinion is purely about the actual film and not a comparison the story and the way it is written is no question it is capote there is no need for more words the play of anthony edwards and eric roberts is superb i have seen some movies with them each in one or the other i was certain that they are good actors and in case of eric i always wondered why his sister is the number famous star and not her brother this time this certainty is raised to fact no question his play just as well as the play of mr edwards is clearly the top of all their profession i recommend this film to be on your top films to see and keep on your dvd shelves mr harvey lights a candle is anchored by a brilliant performance by timothy spall while we can predict that his titular morose up tight teacher will have some sort of break down or catharsis based on some deep down secret from his past how his emotions are unveiled is surprising spall s range of feelings conveyed is quite moving and more than he usually gets to portray as part of the mike leigh repertory while an expected boring school bus trip has only been used for comic purposes such as on the simpsons this central situation of a visit to salisbury cathedral in rhidian brook s script is well contained and structured for dramatic purposes and is almost formally divided into acts we re introduced to the urban british range of racially and religiously diverse kids with their uniforms i couldn t tell if this is a private or public school as they gather the rapping black kids the serious south asians and muslims the white bullies and mean girls but conveyed quite naturally and individually the young actors some of whom i recognized from british tv such as shameless were exuberant in representing the usual range of junior high social pressures celia imrie puts more warmth into the supervisor s role than the martinets she usually has to play a break in the trip leads to a transformative crisis for some while others remain amusingly oblivious we think like the teacher portrayed by ben miles of coupling that we will be spoon fed a didactic lesson about religious tolerance but it s much more about faith in people as well as god which is why the bbc showed it in england at easter time and bbc america showed it in the u s over christmas nathalie press who was also so good in summer of love has a key role in mr harvey s redemption that could have been played for movie of the week preaching but is touching as they reach out to each other in an unexpected way unfortunately i saw their intense scene interrupted by commercials while it is a bit heavy handed in several times pointedly calling this road trip a pilgrimage this quiet film was the best evocation of good will towards men than i ve seen in most holiday themed tv movies i had a feeling that after submerged this one wouldn t be any better i was right he must be looking for champagne money and not care about the final product his voice gets repeatedly dubbed over by a stranger that sounds nothing like him the editing is well just a grade above amateurish it s nothing more than a b or c grade movie with just enough money to hire a couple talented cameramen and an ok sound designer like the previous poster said the problems seem to appear in post production voice dubbing etc too bad cause the plot s actually ok for a sg flick i ll never rent another sg flick unless he emails me asking for forgiveness too bad i miss kelly lebrock jimbo note to george litman and others the mystery science theater riff is i don t think so breeder my favorite riff is why were you looking at his like simply for the complete absurdity that and right well did not over all i would say we must give credit to the mst k crew for trying to ridicule this tv movie you really can t make much fun of the dialog bill s was a good playwright on the other hand this production is so bad that even he would disown it a junior high school drama club could do better i would recommend that you buy a book and read hamlet stephen king adaptation scripted by king himself in which a young family newcomers to rural maine find out about the pet cemetery close to their home the father dale midkiff then finds out about the micmac burial ground beyond the pet cemetery that has powers of resurrection only of course anything buried there comes back not quite right below average horror picture starts out clumsy insulting and inept and continues that way for a while with the absolute worst element being midkiff s worthless performance it gets a little better toward the end with genuinely disturbing finale in point of fact the whole movie is really disturbing which is why i can t completely dismiss it at least it has something to make it memorable decent supporting performances by fred gwynne as the wise old aged neighbor and brad greenquist as the disfigured spirit victor pascow are not enough to really redeem film king has his usual cameo as the minister followed by a sequel also directed by mary lambert is it any wonder that she s had no mainstream film work since the matrix was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually fantastic but also curiously thought provoking in its twilight zone ish manner the general rule applies here and this sequel doesn t match up to its predecessor worse than that it doesn t even compare with it reloaded explodes onto the screen in the most un professional fashion in the opening few seconds the first impression is a generally good one as trinity is shot in a dream immediately after that the film nose dives after a disastrous first minutes it gradually gains momentum when they enter the matrix and the agent smith battle takes place but it loses itself all speed when it reaches the minute car chase sequence and gets even worse at the big groan worthy twist at the end worst of all is the overlong zion rave scene not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the plot but it s also a pathetic excuse for porn and depressive dance music the bullet time aspect of the matrix was a good addition but in reloaded they overuse to make it seem boring in the first one there were interesting plot turns but here it is too linear to be remotely interesting the movie is basically just a series of stylish diversions that prevent us from realising just how empty it really is it works on the incorrect principle that bigger is better it appears that the matrix franchise has quickly descended into the special effects drenched misfire that other franchises such as the star wars saga have the acting standard is poor for the most part the best character of course goes to hugo weaving s agent smith the only one to be slightly interesting keanu reeves is the definitive neo but in all the special effects there is little room to make much of an impact academy award nominee laurence fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with poor dialogue carrie ann moss part as the action chick could have been done much better by any other actress a poor thrown together movie the matrix reloaded is a disappointment those who didn t like the first one are unlikely to flock to it this one s for die hard fans only even in the movie s own sub genre of special effect bonanzas minority report the matrix etc this is still rather poor my imdb rating ulli lommel s film the boogey man is no classic but it s an above average low budget chiller that s worth a look the sequel s boogey man ii is ultimately a waste of time but at the very least it s an entertaining one if not taken the least bit seriously now ii left the door open for another sequel and i for one wouldn t have minded seeing at least one more one day while i was browsing though the videos at a store in the mall i came across a film entitled return of the boogey man when i found out it was a sequel to the earlier films i was happy to shell out a few bucks for it i should have known better though the opening title is boogey man this is no sequel to those two far superior films i named above well not totally anyway pros ha that s a laugh is there anything good about this hunk of cow dung let s see it has footage from the boogey man and um it s mercifully short yeah that s about it cons where to start decisions decisions first of all this movie is a total bore it goes from one scene to the next without anything remotely interesting or scary happening the acting is stiff at best the actors are most likely friends of the director who had no acting experience whatsoever before and probably none since the plot is nonexistent and script shoddily written the direction is just plain awful the director tries to make the film look all artsy fartsy by making the camera move around lights flicker and with filters but it adds nothing the music is dull and hard to hear in parts ties to the original are botched suzanna love s character was named lacey not natalie and the events depicted in the beginning of the original did not take place in also if this has a in the title why is there no mention of what happened in ii finally this adds nothing new or interesting to either the series or the genre final thoughts the people behind this waste of time and money should be ashamed of themselves it s one thing if that had been an original film that was the director s first and sucked but instead it s supposed to be a sequel to film that is no masterpiece but is damn sure far more interesting and entertaining than this if there ever is another sequel which i doubt it then it needs to forget this one ever happened and be handled either by lommel himself or someone who has at least some idea of how to make a decent horror film my rating this movie is one among the very few indian movies that would never fade away with the passage of time nor would its spell binding appeal ever diminish even as the indian cinema transforms into the abyss of artificially styled pop culture while drill oriented extras take to enhancing the p t styled film songs the cinematography speaks of the excellent skills of josef werching that accentuate the monumental and cinema scope effect of the film in its entirety gone are the days of great cinema when every scene had to be clipped many times and retakes taken before finalizing it while meticulous attention was paid in crafting and editing the scenes some of its poignant scenes are filled with sublime emotional intensity like the instance when meena kumari refuses to say yes as an approval for nikah marriage bond and climbs down the hill while running berserk in traumatized frenzy at the moment raj kumar follows her and a strong gale of wind blew away the veil of kumari and onto the legs of kumar kamal amrohi shall always be remembered with golden words in the annals of indian cinema s history for endeavoring to complete this movie in a record setting years he had to manage filming of some of the vital songs without meena s close ups because meena kumari the lady in the lead role was terminally ill and fighting for her life in early most people especially young people may not understand this film it looks like a story of loss when it is actually a story about being alone some people may never feel loneliness at this level cheadles character johnson reflected the total opposite of sandlers character fineman where johnson felt trapped by his blessings fineman was trying to forget his life in the same perspective jada is a wonderful additive to the cast and sandler pulls tears cheadle had the comic role and was a great supporter for sandler i see oscars somewhere here a very fine film if you have ever lost and felt alone this film will assure you that you re not alone jerry soylent green is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction movies of the s and still very persuasive even by today s standards although flawed and a little dated the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise typical for that time still feel very unsettling and thought provoking this film s quality level surpasses the majority of contemporary sf flicks because of its strong cast and some intense sequences that i personally consider classic the new york of is a depressing place to be alive with over population unemployment an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product the only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the soylent company charlton heston in a great shape plays a cop investigating the murder of one of soylent s most eminent executives and he stumbles upon scandals and dark secrets the script is a little over sentimental at times and the climax doesn t really come as a big surprise still the atmosphere is very tense and uncanny the riot sequence is truly grueling and easily one of the most macabre moments in s cinema edward g robinson is ultimately impressive in his last role and there s a great but too modest supportive role for joseph cotton baron blood the abominable dr phibes this is science fiction in my book a nightmarish and inevitable fade for humanity no fancy space ships with hairy monsters attacking our planet michael stearns plays mike a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality he has no problem ogling naked dancers but when women start having sex with men that s when he loses it he believes that when women actually have sex that s when they lose any sense of innocence and or beauty so he strolls through the hollywood hills stalking lovemaking couples at a distance ultimately shooting the men dead with a high powered rifle with a scope the seeming primary reason for this movie s existence is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again the story comes off as more of an afterthought this is bound to make many a happily heterosexual male quite pleased as we re treated to enough protracted scenes of nudity the ladies here look awfully good sans clothes and sex to serve as a major dose of titillation of course seeing a fair deal of it through a scope ups the creepiness factor considerably and illustrates the compulsion towards voyeurism for one thing mike eyes the couples through the scope for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger this is all underscored by awfully intrusive if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrack those with a penchant for lurid trash are bound to enjoy this to one degree or another it even includes one lesbian tryst that confounds mike and renders him uncertain how to react it unfolds at a very slow pace but wraps up with a most amusing ironic twist it s a kinky and twisted rarity that if nothing else is going to definitely keep some viewers glued to the screen this happy go luck military swashbuckler based rather loosely on rudyard kipling s memorable poem as well as his novel soldiers three qualifies as first rate entertainment about the british imperial army in india in the s cary grant delivers more knock about blows with his knuckled up fists than he did in all of his movies put together set in faraway india this six fisted yarn dwells on the exploits of three rugged british sergeants and their native water bearer gunga din sam jaffe who contend with a bloodthirsty cult of murderous indians called the thuggee sergeant archibald cutter cary grant of the last outpost sergeant macchesney oscar winner victor mclaglen of the informer and sergeant ballantine douglas fairbanks jr of the dawn patrol are a competitive trio of hard drinking hard brawling and fun loving alpha males whose years of frolic are about to become history because ballantine plans to marry emmy stebbins joan fontaine and enter the tea business naturally cutter and macchesney drum up assorted schemes to derail ballentine s plans when their superiors order them back into action with sgt bertie higginbotham robert coote of the sheik steps out cutter and macchesney drug higginbotham so that he cannot accompany them and ballantine has to replace him half of the fun here is watching the principals trying to outwit each other without hating themselves director george stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure in grand style and scope as our heroes tangle with an army of thuggees lenser joseph h august received an oscar nomination for his outstanding black white cinematography i would love to have that two hours of my life back it seemed to be several clips from steve s animal planet series that was spliced into a loosely constructed script don t go if you must see it wait for the video the script for this movie was probably found in a hair ball recently coughed up by a really old dog mostly an amateur film with lame fx for you zeta jones fanatics she has the credibility of one mr binks looking for quo vadis at my local video store i found this version that looked interesting wow it was amazing very much a ken russell kind of film quirky stylized very artistic and of course different nero was presented not so much as evil incarnate but as a wacky unfulfilled emperor who would rather have had a circus career he probably wondered why on earth he was put in the position of leading an empire it wasn t much fun and fun is what he longed for klause maria bandaur had a tremendous time with this role and played it for all it was worth yes nero persecuted the christians with a vengeance one of many who did so at one point one of his henchmen murmurs no one will ever understand we were simply protecting ourselves he got that right note to all mad scientists everywhere if you re going to turn your son into a genetically mutated monster you need to give him a scarier name than paul i don t care if he s a frightening hammerhead shark with a mouthful of dagger sharp teeth and the ability to ambush people in the water as well as on dry land give the kid a more worthy name like thor rock or tiburon because even if he eats me up i will probably just sit there laughing ha get a load of this paul the monster is ripping me to shreds that s the worst part about this movie is this shark thing is referred to as paul throughout the entire flick it makes what could have been a decent scary horror movie just seem silly not that there aren t other campy and contrived parts of hammerhead shark frenzy the scientists spend the entire movie wandering along this island and all of a sudden one of the girls starts itching madly from walking in the lush forest and just has to pour water on her feet to relive the itching which of course allows paul to come out of the water and kill her the one thing scifi channel did right in this movie was let the hottie live but that s a small silver lining in an otherwise disappointing movie what the is this this must without a doubt be the biggest waste of film settings and camera ever i know you can t set your expectations for an s slasher high but this is too stupid to be true i baught this film for and i still feel the urge to go claim my money back can you imagine who hard it stinks who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations well actually you couldn t possible care less and why should you the makers of this piece of garbage sure didn t care they didn t try to create a tiny bit of tension the director stephen carpenter i guess it s much easier to find money with a name like that also made the kindred wich was rather enjoyable and recently he did soul survivors complete crap as well but at least that one had eliza dushku this junk has the debut of daphne zuniga who yeah that s right the melrose place chick her very memorable character dies about min after the opening credits she s the second person to die the first victim dies directly in the first minute but nobody seems to mention or miss him afterwards so who cares the rest of the actors they don t deserve the term actors actually are completely uninteresting you re hoping they die a quick and painful death and not only their charactersmy humble opinion intrigued by the synopsis every gay video these days has a hunk on the cover this is not necessarily to be construed as a good sign i purchased ben and arthur without knowing a thing about it this is my second and i assure you it will be my last purchase of a culture q connection video as far as i am concerned this dvd is nothing but a blatant rip off i do not make this observation lightly i am a major collector of videos gay and mainstream and i can state with some authority and without hesitation that ben and arthur is quite simply the worst film i have ever sat through in my life period my collection boasts over films on them on dvd and of those well over are gay and lesbian themed i hardly own every gay movie ever made but i am comfortable in stating that i pretty much purchase almost every gay video of interest that gets released and very often i buy videos without knowing anything about the film sometimes this makes for a pleasant surprise aimee jaguar it s in the water urbania and normal are all examples of excellent gay titles that i stumbled upon accidentally so when i read on the box that ben and arthur concerned a conflict between gay lovers and the christian right one of my favorite subjects i decided to take the plunge sight unseen despite my previously disappointing purchase of another culture q connection title visions of sugar plums that film was pretty bad but compared to ben and arthur it viewed like gone with the wind so what was so wrong with ben and arthur plenty to begin with the plot such as it was was totally ridiculous this film almost made me sympathetic to the christian right we are asked to believe not only that a church would expel a member because his brother is gay but that a priest would actually set up a mob style execution of a gay couple in order to save their souls like this even makes sense the writing is so poor that many scenes make no sense at all and several plot points reflect no logic follow up or connection to the story murder and violence seem to be acceptable ends to the gay activist right wing conflict on both sides and the acting is so bad that it s difficult to imagine how anybody in this film got hired the characters who are supposed to be straight are almost without exception clearly gay and nelly stereotypes to boot the gay characters are neither sexy nor interesting this film is enough to put off anybody from buying gay themed videos forever and the distributors should be ashamed of themselves the only advantage this picture has over my other culture q connection purchase visions of sugarplams is that this one has a soundtrack with clear dialogue hardly a distinction since the script is so insipid that understanding the script only serves to make you more aware of how bad this film truly is it is an embarrassment to queer culture and i intend to warn everyone i possibly can before they waste their money on it at this film would have been way overpriced i understand that it s soon to be re priced under which is still highway robbery i paid the original price of and i never felt more cheated in my life the only true laugh connected with this drivel is the reviews i have seen user reviews for this film on numerous websites and there is always one or two that praise the director writer actor in such a way that it s obvious that the reviewer is a friend of this ed wood wannabe how sad how desperate i just wish imdb would allow you to assign zero stars or even minus zero if ever a film deserved it this is it would anyone really watch this rubbish if it didn t contain little children running around nude from a cinematic point of view it is probably one of the worst films i have encountered absolutely dire some perv woke up one day and thought i will make a film with little girls in and call it art stick them in countryside and there isn t any need for a story or explanation of how they got there or why they don t appear to live anywhere or have parents because p rn films don t need anything like that i would comment on the rest of the film but i haven t ticked spoilers so i will just say avoid avoid avoid and find yourself a proper film to watch unremarkable and unmemorable remake of an old celebrated english film although it may be overly maligned as a total disaster which it is not it never builds any tension and betrays its tv origins richard burton sleepwalks through his role and sophia loren s closed in this movie face doesn t display much passion either simon pegg plays a rude crude and often out of control celebrity journalist who is brought from england to work for a big american magazine of course his winning ways create all sorts of complications amusing fact based comedy that co stars kristen dunst looking rather grown up danny huston and jeff bridges it works primarily because we like simon pegg despite his bad behavior we completely understand why kristen dunst continues to talk to him despite his frequent screw ups i liked the film its not the be all and end all but it was a nice way to cap off an evening of sitting on the couch watching movies out of faithful adaptation of witty and interesting french novel about a cynical and depressed middle aged software engineer or something relying heavily on first person narration but none the worse for that downbeat in a petit bourgeois sort of way philosophical and blackly humorous the best way i could describe both the film and the novel is that it is something like a more intellectual charles bukowski no disrespect to cb intended mordantly funny but also a bleak analysis of social and sexual relations the film s great achievement is that it reflects real life in such a recognisable way as to make you ask why aren t other films like this one of the rare examples of a good book making an equally good film eva hedy lamarr has just got married with an older man and in the honeymoon she realizes that her husband does not desire her her disappointment with the marriage and the privation of love makes eva returning to her father s home in a farm leaving her husband one afternoon while bathing in a lake her horse escapes with her clothes and an young worker retrieves and gives them back to eva they fall in love for each other and become lovers later her husband misses her and tries to have eva back home eva refuses and fortune leads the trio to the same place ending the affair in a tragic way i have just watched extase for the first time and the first remark i have is relative to the horrible quality of the vhs released in brazil by the brazilian distributor video network the movie has only minutes running time and it seems that it was used different reels of film there are some parts totally damaged and other parts very damaged therefore the beauty of the images in not achieved by the brazilian viewer if he has a chance to find this rare vhs in a rental or for sale the film is practically a silent movie the story is very dated and has only a few lines consequently the characters are badly developed however this movie is also very daring with the exposure of hedy lamarr beautiful breasts and naked fat body for the present standards of beauty another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphoric used of flowers symbolizing the intercourse between eva and her lover the way the director conducts the scenes to show the needs and privation of eva is very clear the non conclusive end is also very unusual for a movie i liked this movie but i hope one day have a chance to see a minutes restored version my vote is eight title brazil xtase ecstasy even if this film was allegedly a joke in response to critics it s still an awful film if one is going to commit to that sort of thing at least make it a good joke first off jeroen krabb is i guess the poor man s gerard depardieu naturally i hate gerard depardieu even though he was very funny in the iron mask three musketeer one otherwise to me he is box office poison and jeroen krabb is worse than that the poor man s box office poison really that is not being fair to the economically disenfranchised if the th man is supposed to be some sort of critique of the bourgeoisie what am i saying it isn t let s just say hypothetically if it was supposed to be it wasn t sharp enough satire is a tricky thing if it isn t sharp enough the viewer becomes the butt of the joke instead i think that is what happened the story just ends up as a bunch of miserable disgusting characters doing nothing that anyone would care about and not in an interesting way either for a more interesting and worthwhile application see any luis bunuel film very sharp satire potential spoiler alert really the blow job in the cemetery that jeroen krabb s character works so so hard to attain do you even care is it funny since mr voerhoven is supposed to be a good film maker i will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume it was some misanthropic joke that got out of control though i m guessing he didn t cast jeroen krabb because he s the worst actor and every character he s played has been a pretentious bourgeois ass except he s incompetent at it so it becomes like a weird caricature do you think mr voerhoven did that on purpose and jeroen krabb is the butt of the joke as well i just don t see it so you understand the dilemma i m faced with here right it is the worst film ever because he s supposed to be a good director so there is some kind of dupery involved i knew patch adams was horrible without even seeing it do not be duped by the th man s deceptively alluring packaging or mr voerhoven s reputation as a good director etc etc if you are looking for eye candy you may enjoy sky captain sky captain is just a video game injected with live performers the visials are nice and interesting to look at during the entire movie now saying that the visuals are the only thing good in sky captain after ten minutes i knew i was watching one of the worse movies of all time i was hoping this movie would get better but it never achieved any degree of interest after thirty minutes the urge to walk out kept growing and growing now i own over movies and have seen probably five times that number yet this is only the second movie i felt like walking out of my entire life acting there is none the three main performers are pitiful jude law also in the other movie i wanted to walk out on is just awful in the title role i would rather sit through ben affleck in gigli than watch law again paltrow tries so hard to be campy that it backfires in her face the last article i had read said that paltrow is thinking of staying home and being a mother rather than acting after this performance i would applaud that decision story soap operas are better written the story behind sky captain starts out bad and gets continually worse as it progresses directing none everything was put into the special effects that story acting and directing suffer greatly even the phantom menace had better acting and that is not saying a great deal i would have to give this movie a out of avoid paying theatre prices and wait until video release although at one point i thought this was going to turn into the graduate i have to say that the mother does an excellent job of explaining the sexual desires of an older woman i m so glad this is a british film because hollywood never would have done it and even if they had they would have ruined it by not taking the time to develop the characters the story is revealed slowly and realistically the acting is superb the characters are believably flawed and the dialogue is sensitive i tried many times to predict what was going to happen and i was always wrong so i was very intrigued by the story i highly recommend this movie and i must confess i ll forever look at my mom in a different light dumb is as dumb does in this thoroughly uninteresting supposed black comedy essentially what starts out as chris klein trying to maintain a low profile eventually morphs into an uninspired version of the three amigos only without any laughs in order for black comedy to work it must be outrageous which play dead is not in order for black comedy to work it cannot be mean spirited which play dead is what play dead really is is a town full of nut jobs fred dunst does however do a pretty fair imitation of billy bob thornton s character from a simple plan while jake busey does a pretty fair imitation of well jake busey merk i found this movie quite by accident but am happy that i did kenneth branagh s performance came close to stealing this movie from helena bonham carter but their strong chemistry together made for a much more enjoyable movie this movie brought to mind the excellent movies that branagh made with emma thompson carter s star turn here as a disabled young women seeking to complete herself was as good a performance as i have seen from a female lead in a long time portraying a disabled person is hard to pull off but with basically only her eyes to show her pain about her situation in life she made it so believable if this movie had come out after the current wave of movies with beautiful women uglying themselves up for roles charlize theron halle berry i fell sure carter would have had strong consideration for an oscar if you run across this movie on cable late at night as i did trust me it is worth the lost sleep i ll dispense with the usual comparisons to a certain legendary filmmaker known for his neurotic new yorker persona because quite frankly to draw comparisons with bumbling loser josh kornbluth is just an insult to any such director i will also avoid mentioning the spot on satire office space in the same breath as this celluloid catastrophe i can however compare it to waking up during your own surgery it s painful to watch and you wonder whether the surgeons really know what they re doing haiku tunnel is the kind of film you wish they d pulled the plug on in its early stages of production it was cruel to let it live and as a result audiences around the world are being made to suffer the film s premise if indeed it has one is not even worth discussing but for the sake of caution i will josh kornbluth a temp worker with severe commitment phobia is offered a permanent job his main duty is to mail out high priority letters for his boss but ludicrously he is unable to perform this simple task my reaction big deal that s not a story it s a passing thought at best one that should ve passed any self respecting filmmaker by the leading actor if you can call him that is a clumsy buffoon of a man with chubby features a receding untamed hairline and a series of facial expressions that range from cringe making to plain disturbing where o where did the director find this schmuck what s that you say he is the director oh my mistake playing yourself in your own embarrassment of a screenplay is one thing but i suspect that mr kornbluth isn t that convincing as a human being let alone an actor rest assured this is by no means an aimless character assassination but never before have i been so riled up by an actor s on screen presence my frustration was further confounded by his incessant to camera monologues in between scenes i mean as if the viewer needs an ounce of intelligence to comprehend this drivel kornbluth insults us further by explaining the action first rule of filmmaking dramatize exposition show don t tell who does this guy think he is he has no charisma no charm and judging by his hawaiian shirts no sense of style his casting agent should be shot point blank the supporting actors do nothing to relieve the intense boredom i felt with but one exception patricia scanlon puts in a very funny appearance as helen the ex secretary who has been driven insane by her old boss and makes harassing phone calls from her basement while holding a flashlight under her face this did make me chuckle to myself but the moment soon passed and i was back to checking my watch for the remainder of the film the film s title is also a misnomer haiku tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of japanese poetry don t be fooled into thinking this is an art house film because of its pretentious sounding title or the fact that it only played in a handful of cinemas and made no money at the box office there s a very good reason for that at first sight this movie doesn t look like a particular great one after all a bette davis movies with only votes on imdb and a rating of must be a rather bad one but the movie turned out to be a delightful and original surprise you would at first expect that this is a normal average typical s movie with a formulaic love story but the movie is surprisingly well constructed and has an unusual and original story which also helps to make this movie a very pleasant one to watch the story is carried by its two main characters played by bette davis and george brent their helped by a cast of mostly amusing characters but the movie mainly involves just around them two their character are involved in a most unusual and clever written love story that work humorous as well it makes this movie a delightful little comedy to watch that is perfectly entertaining the movie is quite short just over an hour long which means that the story doesn t waste any time on needless plot lines development and characters it makes the movie also rather fast paced which helps to make this movie a perfectly watchable one by todays standards as well it does perhaps makes the movie a bit of a simple one at times but this never goes at the expense of its entertainment or fun a delightful pleasant simple romantic comedy that deserves to be seen by more well then what is it i found nicholson s character shallow and most unfortunately uninteresting angelica huston s character drained my power and kathleen turner is a filthy no good slut it s not that i don t get it it s not that i don t think that some of the ideas could ve lead to something more this is a film with nothing but the notion that we re supposed to accept these ideas and that s what the movie has going for it that nicholson falls for turner is absurd but then again it is intended to be so this however does not strike me as a funny or b even remotely interesting this was a waste of my time so don t let the hype get the best of you it is a waste of your time with all that being said the opening church sequence is quite beautiful antonio margheriti s danza macabra castle of blood is an eerie atmospheric chiller that succeeds on all fronts it looks absolutely beautiful in black white and it has wonderfully creepy gothic vibe alan foster is an english journalist who pursues an interview with visiting american horror writer edgar allan poe poe bets foster that he can t spend one night in the abandoned mansion of poe s friend thomas blackwood accepting the wager foster is locked in the mansion and the horror begins the film is extremely atmospheric and it scared the hell out of me the crypt sequence is really eerie and the tension is almost unbearable barbara steele looks incredibly beautiful as sinister specter elisabeth blackwood castle of blood is easily one of the best italian horror movies made in early s a masterpiece i don t know who sue kramer the director of this film is but i have a strong suspicion that a she is a lesbian and b she somehow shamed everyone involved in this project to participate to prove they are not homophobic i can imagine everyone thinking my god this is horrible not funny pedestrian totally lame but keeping their mouths shut for fear they will be labeled anti gay or they don t get the gay lifestyle this is probably why kramer did not cast gay people to play gay people too anyway it s not even worth reviewing the actors are all directed to play every scene completely over the top so there is no sincerity or believability in anything they do it s full of clich s and there is nothing about this movie that is the least bit amusing much less funny i hated it and i m not afraid to say so too bad the gutless people who gave kramer the money to make this bomb weren t as unbiased in their judgment i just watched this movie on starz let me go through a few things i thought could have been improved the acting writing directing special effects camera crew sound and lighting it also seemed as though the writers had no idea anything that had to do with the movie apparently back in when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for million now a days those things cost about billion and they cant go invisible apparently you can fly from the us to the middle east in an hour there was a completely random lesbian scene which i didn t mind but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it the camera would randomly zoom in on actors and skip to random scenes oh yeah since its a steven segal movie its predictable as hell all in all i rank it right up there with snakes on a plane i loved the episode but seems to me there should have been some quick reference to the secretary getting punished for effectively being an accomplice after the fact while i like when a episode of columbo has an unpredictable twist like this one its resolution should be part of the conclusion of the episode along with the uncovering of the murderer the interplay between peter falk and ruth gordon is priceless at one point gordon playing a famous writer makes some comment about being flattered by the famous lt columbo making a tongue in cheek allusion to the detective s real life fame as a crime solver this is one of the best of many great columbo installments this film is a massive yawn proving that americans haven t got the hang of farce even when it has already been written for them the original film hodet over vannet is a witty comedy of errors that i would rate it isn t just about a linguistic translation but certain absurd chains of events are skipped entirely robbing the film of its original clever farcical nature and turning it into a cheap oops there go my trousers style of farce i was at the same screenwriters conference and saw the movie i thought the writer sue smith very clearly summarised what the film was about however the movie really didn t need explanation i thought the themes were abundantly clear and inspiring a movie which deals with the the ability to dare to face fear especially fear passed down from parental figures and overcome it and in doing so embrace life s possibilities is a film to be treasured and savoured i enjoyed it much more than the much hyped somersault i also think mandy was a bit unkind to hugo weaving as a bloke about his vintage i should look so good i agree that many australian films have been lacklustre recently but peaches delivers the goods i m glad i saw it when i saw the previews for this movie i didn t expect much to begin with around a second rate teen horror movie but wow this movie was absolutely awful and that s being generous first of all the casting for the movie was terrible you feel no sympathy or for that matter any morbid feeling for the characters the acting was so terrible that i was just simply waiting and hoping for the god awful thing to end secondly there are points in the movie that had absolutely no relation to the plot whatsoever can somebody please explain to me why the girlish looking boy starts screaming pancakes at the top of his lungs while going into jackie chan moves i ve never seen before and even further biting the guy who has the virus why does the father of the kid proceed to get angry with the virus infected guy and go on a redneck hunting spree to find him i was left with a feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that i literally said out loud where the hell did that come from i just simply couldn t believe what i had seen i really thought i had seen some bad movies but i have to say that cabin fever tops them all this movie made me want to puke and then puke again then blow my brains out please save yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive watching grass grow perhaps is a proper alternative okay sorry but i loved this movie i just love the whole s genre of these kind of movies because you don t see many like this one anymore i want to ask all of you people who say this movie is just a rip off or a cheesy imitation what is it imitating i ve never seen another movie like this one well not horror anyway basically its about the popular group in school who like to make everyones lives living hell so they decided to pick on this nerdy boy named marty it turns fatal when he really gets hurt from one of their little pranks so its like years later and the group of friends who hurt marty start getting high school reunion letters but they are the only ones receiving them so they return back to the old school and one by one get knocked off by yeah you probably know what happens the only part that disappointed me was the very end it could have been left off or thought out better i think you should give it a try and try not to be to critical cupidgrl stephane rideau was already a star for his tour de force in wild reeds and he is one of france s biggest indie stars in this film he plays cedric a local boy who meets vacationing mathieu newcomer jamie elkaim in a stunning nuanced ethereal performance at the beach mathieu has a complex relationship with his ill mother demanding aunt and sister with whom he has a competitive relationship soon the two are falling in love the film s fractured narrative which is comprised of lengthy flash backs bits and pieces of the present and real time forward movement into the future is a little daunting director sebastien lifshitz doesn t signal which time period we are in and the story line can be difficult to follow but stick it out the film s final minutes are so engrossing that you won t be able to take your eyes off the screen by turns heart breaking and uplifting this film ranks with beautiful thing as must see cinema though it had the misfortune to hit the festival circuit here in austin sxsw film just as we were getting tired of things like shakespeare in love and elizabeth this movie deserves an audience an inside look at the staging of the scottish play as actors call macbeth when producing it to avoid the curse this is a crisp efficient and stylish treatment of the treachery which befalls the troupe with a wonderfully evocative score and looking and sounding far better than its small budget would suggest this is a quiet gem not world class but totally satisfying yikes this is pretty bad the play isn t great to begin with and the decision to transfer it to film does it no favours especially as peploe doesn t decide how she wants to treat the material s theatrical origins we get occasional glances of an observing theatre audience etc and has decided to go with a jumpy editing style that is intended to keep reminding you that you re watching a film whereas in fact it only serves to remind you that you are watching a very poor film by a director who is overwhelmed by her material mira sorvino s central performance is breath takingly poor stage y and plummy it s as if she s playing the part via helena bonham carter s merchant ivory oeuvre only fiona shaw delivers a performance of note and it may be that her theatrical pedigree means that she is best able to handle the material but it s hard to watch a film for one performance alone even if that performance is as light truthful and entire as shaw s ben kingsley turns in an average and disengaged turn and diana rigg s daughter rachel stirling plays her supporting role as just that sadly none of bertolucci s magic has rubbed off on his wife if this film is to be the evidence last week i took a look at the weekly nielsen ratings and there was veronica mars supposedly the best show you re not watching well they re right that you re not watching it it aired twice and was ranked and out of translation this is the lowest rated show on any nationally broadcast network and deservedly so i tried to watch it a couple of times because of all the press coverage hyping it as a great show a realistic look at life and all such nonsense the reality was otherwise veronica mars is a bore it s as unrealistic as it gets and it richly deserves to be canceled the only mystery is why cw felt compelled to put on its inaugural schedule the lowest rated show in memory after two years of continued commercial and artistic failure what an absolutely crappy film this is how or why this movie was made and what the hell billy bob thornton and charlize theron were doing signing up for this mediocre waste of time is beyond me strong advise for anyone sitting down to catch a flick do not waste your time on this film elizabeth ward gracen who will probably only be remembered as one of bill clinton s bimbo eruptions they have pills for that now is probably the weakest element of this show it really continues the tired formula of the highlander series the hero immortal encounters another immortal with flashbacks about the last time they met but there is some conflict and there is a sword fight at the end where you have a cheap special effects sequence then you have the character of nick wolf basically your typical unshaven s hero with the typical sexual tension storyline seriously why do you hollywood types think sexual tension is more interesting than sex this was a joint canadian french production so half the series takes place in vancouver imitating new york and the other half is in paris just like highlander did they all laughed is a superb peter bogdanovich that is finally getting the recognition it deserves and why their are many reasons the fact that it s set in new york which truly sets the tone the fantastic soundtrack the appealing star turns from ben gazzara and the late john ritter who is superb and of course no classic is complete without audrey hepburn the film is a light and breezy romantic comedy that is very much in the vein of screwball comedy from the thirties film is essentially about the odyssey detective agency which is run by gazzara who with his fellow detectives pot smoking and roller skating eccentric blaine novak the films co producer and john ritter basically the gazzara falls for a rich tycoon magnate s wife hepburn and ritter falls for beautiful dorothy stratten who sadly murdered infamously after production they all laughed is essential viewing for bogdanovich fans what a stunning episode for this fine series this is television excellence at its best the story takes place in and it s beautifully filmed in black white almost a film noir style with its deep shadows and stark images this is a story about two men who fall in love but i don t want to spoil this it is a rare presentation of what homosexuals faced in the s in america written by the superb tom pettit and directed by the great jeannot szwarc we move through their lives their love for each other and their tragedy taking on such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more stunning our emotions are as torn and on edge as the characters chills ran up my spine at the end when they played bob dylan s gorgeous ah but i was so much older then i m younger than that now as sung by the byrds this one goes far past a and all the way to the stars beautiful this movie was o k but it could have been much better there are some spooky moments but there aren t enough of them to make me ever want to see this movie again there are some scenes you could fast forward through not miss anything the biggest flaw is that it is so predictable that is the reason why i rated it so low it s watchable but don t expect anything great as i understand it after the chinese took over hong kong the infamous cat hong kong movies kind of disappeared at least until now and what an amazing movie this one is i knew it was a rough crime drama going in but being the first cat i ve purchased that s been made recently i wasn t sure what to expect a cambodian hit man goes to hong kong to knock off the wife of a judge who is also a lawyer turns out the judge made the arrangements for the hit man because she was divorcing the judge and threatening to take all his money this is all known within the first ten minutes so nothing is being given away after the hit the cops locate the hit man pretty fast but in trying to arrest him several police officers and civilians are killed he eludes the police and now the race is on to catch the guy before he escapes back to cambodia this is a movie that never stops and hardly gives the viewer a chance to catch their breath yes it is very violent and intense many cops are killed as the hit man proves very very hard to track and take down when they do locate him along the way the hit man in trying to hide in a dump finds a women being raped and mistreated by some man he helps her and saves her from the guy and she persuades the hit man to take her along with him in his escape i loved this movie it s like a roller coaster that just keeps moving and moving at high speed as one incident leads to another and the police at times are just as bad or worse as the hit man the acting is exceptionally good and the location filming and photography is at time breathtaking there s no let up in this movie not even with the very very incredible ending the ending is pretty much unbelievable and also a fitting end to all the action and violence yes the violence is brutal at times but this is a very no nonsense crime drama that will knock your socks off dog eat dog definitely needs a more widespread release including an r release for sure great movie highly recommended yes this is a horror anthology film and it was a lot of fun that s because although the film clearly was horror some of the stories had a light spirit and there were even occasionally a few laughs this isn t at all a bad thing as sometimes horror films are a bit stuffy and overly serious because of this and because all four of the stories were pretty good it s one of the better movies of this style i have seen the unifying theme that connects each story is the house itself four different stories involve people who either rent the home or investigate what happened to the tenants the first segment starred denholm elliott as a horror writer who has writer s block so for a change of scenery they rent this house almost immediately elliott s block vanishes and he works steadily on a tale about a serial killer amazingly soon after his block vanishes he begins to actually see his fictional character again and again the psychotic killer appears and then disappears making it seem as if he is losing his mind this might just be the best of the stories as the nice twist ending makes the story come alive the second while not bad at all is probably the weakest peter cushing plays a bachelor who is pining for a girl friend who died some time ago though the picture of her looked amazingly contemporary when he enters a chamber of horrors wax museum in town he sees a wax figure that reminds him of his lost lady and he is both fascinated and scared by this later a friend joss ackland visits and he too sees the figure and is entranced by it this all leads to an ending that frankly was a bit of a letdown christopher lee then stars as an incredibly harsh and stern father to a pathetic little girl during most of this segment lee seemed like an idiot but in the end you can understand his demeanor though slow this one ended very well the fourth segment was the silliest and was meant to parody the genre jon pertwee the third doctor from the dr who television series is a very temperamental actor known for his portrayals of dracula however nothing is right about the film according to him and in a fit of pique he stomps off the set to find better props for this vampire film it s actually pretty interesting that he played this role as it seemed like a natural for christopher lee who played dracula or other vampires a bazillion times give or take a few i enjoyed pertwee s line when he basically said that lee s and other recent incarnations of dracula were all crap compared to bela lugosi s perhaps this is why lee didn t take this part despite some very silly moments it was very entertaining and fun possibly as good or better than the first segment considering that the film started and ended so well had excellent acting and writing it s hard not to like this film a charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town cats and death soon follow them that about sums it up i ll admit that i am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie but in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film and believe me there is plenty of that to go around it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experience the characters are more like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on fear greed pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people although it can be argued that that seeming failing in actuality serves the telling of the story the supernatural premise and the fact that it is a stephen king screenplay not that i have anything specific against mr king are quite nicely supported by some interesting fx work makeup and quite suitable music the absolute gem of this film is without a doubt alice krige who plays mary brady the otherworldly mother king manages to take a simple story of outsider or people who are a little different okay a lot in this case trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan i rented this movie because it falls under the genres of romance and western with some grand canyon scenery thrown in but if you re expecting a typical wholesome romantic western forget it this movie is pure trash the romance is between a young girl who has not even gone through puberty and a middle aged man the child is also lusted after by other leering men it s sickening peter fonda is portrayed as being virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to brooke shields and her character is mostly the one that pursues the relationship he tries to shoo her off at first but eventually he gives in and they drive off as a happy loving couple it s revolting i don t see how this movie could appeal to anyone except pedophiles i first saw this film as a teenager it was at a time when heavy metal ruled the world trick or treat has every element for a movie that rocks with a cast that features skippy from family ties gene simmons of kiss and ozzy osbourne as a preacher how can you go wrong backwards evil messages played on vinyl yes thats right they use records in this movie in one scene eddie skippy is listening to a message from the evil rockstar on his record player when things begin to get scary monsters start to come out of his speakers and his stereo becomes possessed as a teenager i tried playing my records backwards hoping it would happen to mine almost years later trick or treat is still one of my all time favorite movies it is so sad even though this was shot with film i think it stinks a little bit more than flicks like blood lake there s nothing out there the music they play in this is the funniest stuff i ve ever heard i like the brother and sister in this movie they both don t try very hard to sound sarcastic when they re saying stuff like my friends are going to be so jealous hey whats with the killer only wearing his mask in the beginning thats retarded i practically ignored the second half of this my favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the axe the same exact sound for every chop a somewhat dull made for tv movie which premiered on the tbs cable station antonio and janine run around chasing a killer computer virus and that s about it for trivia buffs this will be noted as debuting the same weekend that the real life melissa virus also made it s debut in e mail inboxes across the world warning possible spoilers but not really keep reading ahhh there are so many reasons to become utterly addicted to this spoof gem that i won t have room to list them all the opening credits set the playful scene with kitsch late s cartoon stills an enchanting peres prez prado mambo theme which appears to be curiously uncredited but his grunts are unmistakable and no one else did them and with familiar cast names including kathy najimi a full year before she hit with sister acts plus teri hatcher from tv s superman every scene is imbued with shallow injustices flung at various actors actresses and producers in daytime tv peeking behind the careers of these people is all just an excuse for an old fashioned delicious farce robert harling penned this riotous spoof that plays like an issue of mad magazine but feels like a gift to us in the audience some of the cliched characters are a bit dim but everyone is drizzling with high jealousy especially against celeste talbert sally field who is the show s perennial award winning lead nicknamed america s sweetheart the daytime emmies like awards opening does introduce us to celeste s show the sun also sets against all vain fears to the contrary celeste wins again she is overjoyed because it s always such a genuine thrill adam did you watch i won well nguh the reason for adam s absence soon becomes the justification for the entire plot and we re instantly off on a trip with celeste s neuroses she cries screeches and wrings her hands though the rest of the movie while her dresser tawnee kathy najimi constantly waddling after celeste unseen through celeste s fog of paranoia indulges a taste for tammy faye baker for which tawnee had been in fact specifically hired rosie schwartz whoopi goldberg has seen it all before she is the head writer of the show and she and celeste have been excellent support networks to each other for years so when celeste freaks rosie offers to write her off the show for six months we ll just say that maggie went to visit with the dalai lama but celeste has doubts i thought that the dalai lama moved to la well then some other lama fernando lamas come on such a skewering line must be rather affronting to still living beefcake actor lorenzo lamas son of aforementioned fernando lamas d those who can remember the economics teacher ben stein in ferris bueller s day off as he deadeningly calls the roll bueller bueller bueller will take secret pleasure from seeing him again as a nitwit writer other well hidden member of the cast include garry marshall in real life mr happy days and brother of penny who gets paid million to make the command decisions on the sun also sets he says he definitely likes peppy and cheap and carrie fisher as betsy faye sharon who s a bitch geoffrey anderson kevin kline is the yummy with a spoon and he is by the way dinner theater actor now rescued from his hell by david seaton barnes robert downey jr and brought back to the same show he was canned from years earlier of course this presents some logical challenges for the current scriptwriters because his character rod randall was supposed to have been decapitated all those years ago somehow they work out the logical difficulties and geoffrey anderson steps off the choo choo celeste can now only get worse and her trick of going across the washington bridge no longer helps first her hands shake as she tries to put on mascara but she soon degenerates into a stalker unfortunately she cannot get rid of geoffrey anderson so easily geoffrey s been promised development of his one man play about hamlet and he means to hold the producer to that promise i m not going back to florida no how argues geoffrey you try playing willie loman in front of a bunch of old farts eating meatloaf and indeed seeing geoffrey s dinner theater lifestyle amongst all the hocking and accidents is hilarious back in florida in his willie loman fat suit in his room geoffrey anderson used to chafe at being called to stage as mr loman he was forced to splat whatever cockroaches crawled across his tv with a shoe and to use pliers instead of the broken analog channel changer now he find himself as the yummy surgeon dating laurie craven the show s new ingenue so he s not leaving beautiful elizabeth shue as laurie rounds out the amazing ensemble cast who all do the fantastic job of those who know the stereotypes all too well but of course the course to true love never did run smoothly montana moorehead cathy moriarty is getting impatient waiting for her star to rise and is getting desperate for some publicity will her plots finally succeed will celeste settle her nerves or will she kill tawnee first will the producer get mr fuzzy you ll just have to watch the second half of this utterly lovable farcically malicious riot and you ll really have to see to believe how the short sighted geoffrey reads his lines without glasses live off the teleprompter if you are not in stitches with stomach heaving laughter and tears pouring down your face feel free to demand your money back for the video rental soapdish is an unmissable gem that you will need to see again and again because it s not often that a movie can deliver so amply with so many hilarious lines this is very well crafted humor almost all of it in the writing a draw with blazing saddles for uproarious apoplexy value although otherwise dissimilar watch it and weep a happy source for anyone s video addiction out of i was hoping that this film was going to be at least watchable the plot was weak to say the least i was expecting a lot more considering the cast line up i wonder if any of them will include this on their cvs at least i didn t pay to rent it the best part of the film is definitely dani behr but the rest of the film is complete and utter pants the king of masks is a beautifully told story that pits the familial gender preference towards males against human preference for love and companionship set in s china during a time of floods we meet wang an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and capture the awe of all who witness him when a famous operatic performer sees and then befriends wang he invites wang to join their troupe however we learn that wang s family tradition allows him only to pass his secrets to a son learning that wang is childless wang is encouraged to find an heir before the magic is lost forever taking the advice to heart wang purchases an year old to fulfill his legacy he would teach his new son doggie the ancient art of silk masks soon wang discovers a fact about doggie that threatens the rare and dying art together wang and doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotions that invariably accompany it the story is absorbing the setting is serene and the costuming simple summarily it is an international award winning art film which can t help but to move and inspire i really wanted to like this film but the story is ridicules i don t want to spoil this film don t worry right from the begin you know something bad is going to happen but here s an example of how sloppy this film was put together the cowboy and twig ride up the ridge the cowboy has a handle bar mustache the cowboy and twig get into a shoot out and race half way down the ridge the cowboy is clean shaven through out the rest of the film sometime between the gun fight and the ride down the mountain the cowboy has had time to shave in dark on the back of a horse to be fair the acting by the four main characters is solid i am a big fan of cinema verite and saw this movie because i heard how interesting it was i can honestly say it was very interesting indeed the two lead actors are awesome the film isn t ever boring and the concept behind it though obviously inspired by the columbine killings and the home movies of the killers is really interesting there are some weaknesses such as the final minutes which really detracts from the realism seen in the first hour or so and the ending really doesn t make any sense at all the shaky camera sometimes can be a distraction but in cinema verite that is a given but i still think the movie is very well done and the director ben coccio deserves some credit how do i begin to review a film that will soon be recognized as the worst film of all time by the worst director of all time a film that could develop a cult following because it s so bad it s good an analytical approach criticizing the film seems both pointless and part of band wagon syndrome let s bash freely without worry of backlash because every other human on earth is doing it and the people who like the film like it for those flaws we d cite the film s universal poor quality goes without saying sixteen years of alcohol is not without competition for title of worst film so it has to sink pretty low to acquire the title and keep a hold of it but i believe this film could go the distance imdb doesn t allow enough words to cite all the films failures and it be much easier to site the elements sixteen years of alcohol does right unfortunately those moments of glory are so far buried in the shadows of this film s poorness that that s a task not worth pursuing my impressions i thought i knew what i was getting into i had been warned to drink several cups of coffee before sitting down to watch this one wish that suggestion had been cups of vodka despite my low expectations sixteen years of alcohol failed to entertain me even on a make fun of the bad movie level not just bad but obnoxiously bad as though jobson intentionally tried to make this film a poetical yawn but went into overkill and shoved the poetry down our throats making it not profound but funny and supposedly jobson sincerely tried to make a good movie even after viewing the sixteen years of alcohol promotional literature i have trouble believing jobson s sincerity pointless and obnoxious till the end with a several grin chuckle moments all i m sure none intentional spiced the film and those few elements prevented me from turning the dvd off so bad it s good no it had just enough i can t believe this is a serious movie moments to keep me from turning it off and nothing more definitely a film to watch with a group of bad movie connoisseurs get your own running commentary going that would ve significantly improved the experience for me so bad it s mike myers commentating in his cod scottish accent on it as it runs to turn this whole piece of sludge into a comic farce ok dare ma man pass me annuder gliss of dat wiskey you ve been fouled and beaten up in submission by my harsh statements about femme fatale guns n gals movies now comes another breed in disappointing rediscoveries ninja movies many of these i ve seen before and let me tell you they aren t all that s cracked up to be they usually don t stick to the point this among all others suffers from no originality what s a ninja got to do with preventing a nuclear holocaust in russia and isn t this supposed to be a martial arts movie too does plenty of gunfire sound like an incredible action movie to you is blood the number one reason to love this to death will you waste some of your hard earned cash over a lady singing in her see through tank top the answers to these important questions are found in the ninja mission which should be in the martial arts section of your video store for even more nonsense ninja fun try checking out those godfrey ho movies put out by trans world you get what you deserve and that s a promise recommended only for hardcore ninja addicts as to the level of wit on which this comedy operates barely even reaching feature length can i do it till i need glasses is a collection of mostly dirty jokes many of them are so short that you can t believe it when you realize that that was supposed to be the punchline example the santa claus gag others are so long that you can t believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to set up that punchline example the students awards gag and nearly all are directed without any artistry don t get me wrong about every jokes actually manages to be funny the iron phone one is probably my favorite there is also some wonderful full frontal nudity that proves yet again that the female body especially in its natural form is the best thing on this planet there is some comedic male nudity as well and i agree with others that the intentionally stupid title song is actually pretty damn catchy but none of those reasons are enough to give this film anything more than out of i have been a huge lynn peterson fan ever since her breakthrough role in the blockbuster movie far north and even though i loved her in her one other film slow where she plays francis this is by far and away her strongest role lynn as i m sure you all know or should plays the critical role of driver unfortunately other than lynn s amazing performance i m afraid this movie doesn t really have much going for it oh wait there was one other thing the amazing creativity of the editing to remove profanity for tv viewers memorable lines like you son of a gun you son of a witch shoot and well forget you o k bye p s does anyone know where i can get another lynn peterson poster often laugh out loud funny play on sex family and the classes in beverly hills milks more laughs out of the zip code than it s seen since the days of granny and jed clampett plot centers on two chauffers who ve bet on which one of them can bed his employer both single or soon to be single ladies quite sexy bisset and woronov first if manuel wins his friend will pay off his debt to a violent asian street gang if he loses he must play bottom man to his friend lots of raunchy dialogue fairly sick physical humour etc but a lot of the comedy is just beneath the surface bartel is memorable as a very sensual oder member of the family who ends up taking his sexy teenaged niece on a year long missionary trip to africa hilarious fun some very interesting camera work and a story with much potential but it never comes together as anything more than a student s graduate thesis in film school there are two primary reasons for this fist there is not a single likable character not even a villain we might admire for his her chutzpah secondly all the acting is awful even from veteran willem dafoe the ham is so plentiful here you feel like you re at a picnic but one of those wretched company employee picnics where you drink too much cheap beer and get your hangover before you even stop drinking then you eat an underdone hotdog and throw up all right i m being a little rough on a young director who might still go places as i said the camera work is quite good but i feel cheated the blurb for this film suggests we will get to watch a modern western and the dvd packaging has pictures on it that suggest this as well but nobody actually connected to the film s making seems to know that this is the kind of film they re supposed to be making that betrayal is what hurts but even without it the fact remains that we don t like these characters we feel embarrassed for the actors the story is hopelessly muddled and in the last analysis we just don t care i took it out of the dvd player about half way through but the rental store wouldn t give me my money back now that really hurts the original demille movie was made in with frederic march a very good film indeed hollywood s love of remakes brings us a fairly interesting movie starring yul brynner he of course was brilliant as he almost always seemed to be in all of his movies charlton heston as andrew jackson was a stroke of genius however the movie did tend to get a little long in places it does not move at the pace of the version still it is a fun movie that should be seen at least once before watching this movie i thought this movie will be great as flashpoint because before watching this movie flashpoint was the last jenna jameson and brad armstrong movie i previously watched as far as sexual scenes are concerned i was disappointed i thought sexual scenes of dreamquest will be great as flashpoint sexual scenes but i was disappointed except asia carrera s sexual scene any sexual scene in this movie doesn t make me feel great you know what i mean the great jenna jameson doesn t do those kind of sexual scenes of what she is capable of felecia and stephanie swift both of those lovely girls disappoint me as well as far as sexual scenes are concerned although its a adult movie but if you aside that sexual scenes factor this movie is very good if typical adult movie standards are concerned this movie definitely raised the standards of adult movies story acting direction sets makeups and other technical stuff of this movie are really great the actors of this movie done really good acting they all done a great job dreamquest is definitely raised the bar of quality of adult movies jeanette macdonald and nelson eddy star in this modern musical that showcases macdonald s comic abilities surreal s musical seem to be making fun of s fashions even as they were in current vogue eye popping costumes and sets yes b w add to the surreal dreamlike quality of the entire film several good songs enliven the film with the twinkle in your eye number a total highlight including a fun jitterbug number between macdonald and binnie barnes also in the huge cast are edward everett horton reginal owen mona maris douglas dumbrille and anne jeffreys also to been seen in extended bit parts are esther dale almira sessions grace hayle gertrude hoffman rafaela ottiano odette myrtile cecil cunningham and many others great fun and nice to see the wonderful macdonald in her jitterbug vamp routines she could do it all i love this movie my friend marcus and i were browsing the local hastings because we had an urge to rent something we had never seen before and stumbled across this fine film we had no idea what it was going to be about but it turned out spectacular thumbs up i liked how the film was shot and the actors were very funny if you are are looking for a funny movie that also makes you think i highly suggest you quickly run to your local video store and find this movie i would tell you some of my favorite parts but that might ruin the film for you so i won t this movie is definitely on my top list of good movies do you really think nothing is bouncy those who are not familiar with cassandra peterson s alter ego elvira then this is a good place to start elvira mistress of the dark starts off with our heroine with the gravity defying boobs receiving a message it seems that a great aunt of hers has died and that she needs to be present for the reading of the will anxious to raise money for a show she wants to open in las vegas she decides to go in hopes of getting lots and lots of money unfortunately the place she has to go is the town of fallwell massachusetts having to stay a spell due to her car breaking down she finds out that her great aunt left her things a house a dog and a cookbook the town residents have mixed reactions the teens like her the women hate her and the men lust after her although trying to remain moral pillars of the community her worst problem turns out to be her great uncle vincent w morgan sheppard because he wants her cookbook seems that the cookbook is a book of spells that will make him a more powerful warlock the film is actually pretty funny with peterson a k a elvira using her endowments and sexiness as a joke and don t forget tomorrow we re showing the head with two things i mean the thing with two heads especially funny as edie mcclurg as chastity pariah the woman that works her hardest to keep the town in line but ends up looking ridiculous the picnic scene is the perfect example deserves a peek the film not her boobs of course a sequel to actually a remake of disney s live action remake of dalmations cruella devil glenn close is released from prison after being cured of her obsession with fur by a psychologist named dr pavlov ugh but the cure is broken when cruella hears the toll of big ben and she once again goes on a mad quest to make herself the perfect coat out of dalmation hides this movie is bad on so many levels starting with the fact that it s a thanksgiving family schlock movie designed to suck every last available dime out of the disney marketing machine glenn close over over over over acts as cruella with all that she had to put up with in this movie the lame script the endless makeup getting baked in a cake at the end i hope they gave her an extremely large paycheck speaking of which where in the world are you going to find a fur coat factory a bakery with a rube goldberg assembly line and a candlelight restaurant all located within the same building as you do in the climax of this film of course the real stars of the movie are supposed to be the dogs they serve as the macaulay culkin s of this movie pulling all the stupid home alone gags on the villains biting them in the crotch running over their hands with luggage carts squirting them with icing etc etc etc ad nauseum i have to admit the dogs were fairly good actors much better than the humans gerard depardieu is completely wasted in this movie as a freaked out french furrier the two human dog lovers rehashed from the earlier film but with different actors are completely boring when they have a spaghetti dinner at an italian restaurant the movie cuts back and forth between the two lovers and their dogs at home watching the dinner scene from lady and the tramp i thought to myself oh please don t go there i half expected the humans to do a satire on the lady and the tramp dinner scene as charlie sheen did in hot shots part deux doing the spaghetti strand kiss pushing the meatball with his nose etc and don t get me started on the annoying parrot with eric idle s voice the costumes were nominated for an oscar and the costumes in the movie are good but they are the only good thing in the movie the rest of it is unbearable dreck there are movies like plan that are so bad they have a charm about them there are some like waterworld that have the same inexplicable draw as a car accident and there are some like desperate living that you hate to admit you love cowgirls have none of these redemptions the cast assembled has enough talent to make almost any plot watchable and from what i ve been told the book is enjoyable how then could this movie be so intolerably bad to begin with it seems the director brought together a cast of names with no other tie than what will bring in the somethings then tell them to do their best kevin costner imitations open the book at random and start shooting whatever is on the page making sure to keep the wide expanses of america from being interesting in any way finally give the editing job to your brother in law because the meat packing plant just laid him off he does have twenty years of cutting experience this movie now defines the basement for me it is so bad it isn t even good for being bad and i m serious truly one of the most fantastic films i have ever had the pleasure of watching what s so wonderful is that very rarely does a good book turn into a movie that is not only good but if possible better than the novel it was based on perhaps in the case of lord of the rings and trainspotting but it is a rare occurrence indeed but i think that the fact that louis sachar was involved from the beginning helped masses so that the film sticks close to the story but takes it even further this film has many elements that make it what it is a unique original story with a good mix of fun and humour but a mature edge brilliant actors adults and kids alike these actors know how to bring the story to life and deliver their lines with enthusiasm and style without going overboard as sometimes happen with kids movies breathtaking scenery and it doesn t matter if it s real or cgi the setting in itself is a masterpiece i especially love the image of the holes from a birds eye view a talented director who breathes life into the book and turns it into technicolour genius the transitions in time work well and capture the steady climax from the book leading up to the twists throughout the film louis sachar the guy who had me reading a book nonstop from start to finish so that i couldn t put it down he makes sure that the script sticks to the book with new bits added in to make it even better and speaking of the script the one liners in this are smart funny and unpatronising but there are also parts to make you smile make you cry and tug at your heartstrings to make you love this story all the more beautiful soundtrack there s not a song in this film that i haven t fallen for and that s something considering i m supposed to be a punk rocker the songs link to the story well and add extra jazz to the overall style of the film if you re going to buy the film i recommend you buy the soundtrack too especially for if only which centres around the story and contains the chorus from the book i do not work for the people who made holes by the way i m just a fan plugging my favourite film and giving it the review it deserves if you haven t seen it do it now this very instant go channel surfing and caught this on logo it was one of those i have to watch this because it s so horribly bad moments like roadhouse without the joy the writing is atrocious completely inane and the acting is throw up in your mouth bad there s low budget and then there is the abyss which is where this epic should be tossed and never seen from again i mean the main characters go to a ski retreat in some rented house and the house is well ordinary which is no big deal but they choose to show all the houseguests pouring over it like it was the sistine chapel i m sorry but watching guys stare into every x boring room with a futon in it and gushing is lame i guess they didn t learn anything from the bad news bears in breaking training see hotel room check scene wow a toilet yaayyyyy i don t buy the its all over the top so anything goes routine if it smells like and it looks like well you know the rest avoid like the plague edit apparently other more close minded reviewers believe that since i disliked this movie i am an obvious hater which i can only assume means i am phobic which of course is not true i decided to do this wacky crazy thing and judge the movie based on the actual content of the film and not by its mere presence i e its refreshing to see sure it may be refreshing to see but that doesn t equate into a great movie just give them some better material to work with and tighter direction in fact i applaud the effort frankly i d rather go listen to my kitchens of distinction catalogue than watch this again when i first saw the romeo division last spring my first reaction was brilliant however on future viewings i was provided with much more than masterful film making this picture has a singular voice that will echo throughout the annuls of film history the opening montage provides a splendid palette which helmer jp sarro uses to establish his art on this canvas of entertainment sarro truly uses the camera as his paintbrush while he brings us along on a ride that envelops the audience in a tremendous action movie that goes beyond the traditional format we have become accustomed to and dives deeply into dark themes of betrayal revenge and the importance of companionship this movie is any director s dream at its very core however sarro was not alone in this epic undertaking the writing provided by scribe tim sheridan was just as breathtaking the dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors such presence and charisma on the screen specifically speaking the final scene warning spoilers spoilers where vanessa reveals herself to be one of the coalition and a villain all the time is written in such a dark tone that it is one of the most chilling endings i have ever seen sheridan is the next robert towne in a final note it is obvious that this production was no small feat therefore much praise must be given to producer scott shipley who seems to have the creativity and genius to walk next to jerry bruckheimer never before have i witnessed a production so grand with so much attention directed at every little detail a producers job is one of the hardest in any movie and shipley makes it look easy all in all this film combines creative writing stunning production and masterful direction this is the art of film at its best when the ending of the film arrives the only thing that is desired is more the romeo division is groundbreaking a masterpiece and most importantly the romeo division is indeed art it looks to me as if the creators of the class of nuke em high wanted it to become a cult film but it ends up as any old high school b movie only tackier the satire feels totally overshadowed by the extremely steretyped characters it s very un funny even for a turkey i totally agree that nothing is a fantastic film i ve not laughed so much when watching a film for ages and david hewlett and andrew miller are fantastic in this they really work well together this film may not appeal to some people i can t really say why without spoiling it but each to their own i loved it and highly recommend it the directing is great and some of the shots are very clever it looks as though they may have had a lot of fun when filming it although there are really only main characters in the film and not an awful lot of props the actors manage to pull it off and make the film enjoyable to watch this isn t the worst movie i ve ever seen but i really can t recall when i ve seen a worse one i thought this would be about an aircraft accident investigation what it really was is a soap opera and a bad one at that they overplayed the conflict card to the extreme the first hour or so seems like a shouting match with some implausible scenes thrown in possible spoiler the or so minute memorial scene with requisite black umbrellas and rain to fictitious crash victims was lame and i thought it would never end avoid this one at all costs unless you revel in conflict beautiful attracts excellent idea but ruined with a bad selection of the actors the main character is a loser and his woman friend and his friend upset viewers apart from the first episode all the other become more boring and boring first it considers it illogical behavior no one normal would not behave the way the main character behaves it all represents a typical halmark way to endear viewers to the reduced amount of intelligence does such a scenario or the casting director and destroy this question is on halmark producers cat is the main character is wonderful the main character behaves according to his friend selfish complete drivel an unfortunate manifestation of the hypocritical toxic culture of a decade ago in this movie pedestrian regrets for slavery go hand in hand with colonialist subtexts the annoying redhead feeding shaka rice forget historical reality too didn t most western slaves comes from west africa an american slaver easily capturing shaka with a handful of men finally david hasslehoff could not have been any more obnoxious one can only ponder how would he have fared in the miniseries promptly impaled most likely the miniseries was superb and it is unfortunate that dh should have gotten his hands on something unique and made it mundane i tend to think that he had hand in creating this fiasco okay first of all i got this movie as a christmas present so it was free first this movie was meant to be in stereoscopic d it is for the most part but whenever the main character is in her car the movie falls flat to d what it s not that hard to film in a car second the story isn t very good there are a lot of things wrong with it third why are they showing all of the deaths in the beginning of the film it made the movie suck whenever some was going to get killed watch it for a good laugh but don t waste your time buying it just download it or something for cheap as soon as it hits a screen it destroys all intelligent life forms around but on behalf of its producers i must say it doesn t fall into any known movie category it deserves a brand new denomination of its own it s a neurological drama it saddens and depresses every single neuron inside a person s brain it s the closest thing one will ever get to a stroke without actually suffering one it drives you speechless all you members go numb your mouth falls open and remains so and the most strange symptom of all is that you get yourself wishing to go blind and deaf no small feat for such a sort of a movie the only word that comes to my mind just having finished my ordeal is outrage unfortunately for myself i stumbled onto this show late in it s lifetime i only caught a few episodes about three before it was cancelled by abc i loved the characters and storyline but most of all the great actors i was a fan of sex and the city so i saw two characters i recognized bridget moynahan was the character todd was smith jared as well as jay hernandez from carlito s way rise to power and erika christensen swimfan i enjoy watching young actors get their due and felt like this show would propel their career further along i hope this at least gets put back out on dvd and maybe wb will pick it up for a second season sometime in the meantime i m viewing it on abc s website from the beginning i had never heard of this one before it turned up on cable tv it s very typical of late s sci fi sober depressing and not a little paranoid despite the equally typical inclusion of a romantic couple the film is pretty much put across in a documentary style which is perhaps a cheap way of leaving a lot of the exposition to narration and an excuse to insert as much stock footage as is humanly possibly for what is unmistakably an extremely low budget venture while not uninteresting in itself the apocalypse via renegade missile angle later utilized with far greater aplomb for both dr strangelove and fail safe and mercifully short the film s single minded approach to its subject matter results in a good deal of unintentional laughter particularly in the scenes involving an imminent childbirth and a gang of clueless juvenile delinquents this was a hit in the south by southwest sxsw film festival in austin last year and features a fine cast headed up by e r s gloria reuben and a scenery chewing john glover though shot on a small budget in nyc the film looks and sounds fabulous and takes us on a behind the scenes whirl through the rehearsal and mounting of what actors call the scottish play as a reference to the word macbeth is thought to bring on the play s ancient curse the acting company exhibits all the emotions of the play itself lust jealousy rage suspicion and a bit of fun as well the games begin when an accomplished actor is replaced in the lead role by a well known pretty face from the tv soap opera scene in order to draw bigger crowds the green eyed monster takes over from there and the drama unfolds nicely fine soundtrack and good performances all around the dvd includes director s commentary and some deleted scenes as well i gave to this film i can t understand how ettore scola one of the greater directors of italian cinema made a film like this so stupid and ridiculous all the stories of the people involved in the movie are unsubstantial boring and not interesting too long too boring the only things i save in this movie are giancarlo giannini and vittorio gasmann hope that scola will change radically themes and style in his next film as a big fan of david mamet s films and plays especially his first film house of games that also starred joe mantegna i was expecting great things from this film instead i found myself annoyed by the film s superficiality and lack of credibility racial slurs are thrown about without any feeling or meaning behind them in the hopes of setting up a racial tension that for me never materialized identity is totally reevaluated and men become heroes for no apparent reason because of his oaths taken as a cop the lead character adamantly refuses to perform one relatively small action that would harm no one and could possibly save lives and yet performs another action which is very violent and very illegal but then still refuses the minor action in addition a highly unbelievable subplot involving a man who has killed his family is introduced just for the sake of a plot point that was all but advertised with skywriting and the cop s reaction to that occurrence stretch credulity way beyond all reasonable limits needless to say after expecting another exciting thriller from david mamet i was extremely disappointed to say the least out of i may not be a critic but here is what i think of this movie well just watched the movie on cinemax and first of all i just have to say how much i hate the storyline i mean come on what does a snowman scare besides little kids secondly it is pretty gory but i bet since the movie is so low budget they probably used ketchup so my critical vote is bomb nice try and the sequel will suck twice as much watching time chasers it obvious that it was made by a bunch of friends maybe they were sitting around one day in film school and said hey let s pool our money together and make a really bad movie or something like that what ever they said they still ended up making a really bad movie dull story bad script lame acting poor cinematography bottom of the barrel stock music etc all corners were cut except the one that would have prevented this film s release life s like that i saw this film about years ago and remember it as being particularly nasty i believe it is based on a true incident a young man breaks into a nurses home and rapes tortures and kills various women it is in black and white but saves the colour for one shocking shot at the end the film seems to be trying to make some political statement but it just comes across as confused and obscene avoid minor spoilersin new york joan barnard elvire audrey is informed that her husband the archeologist arthur barnard john saxon was mysteriously murdered in italy while searching an etruscan tomb joan decides to travel to italy in the company of her colleague who offers his support once in italy she starts having visions relative to an ancient people and maggots many maggots after shootings and weird events joan realizes that her father is an international drug dealer there are drugs hidden in the tomb and her colleague is a detective of the narcotic department the story ends back in new york when joan and her colleague decide to get married with each other in a very romantic end yesterday i had the displeasure of wasting my time watching this crap the story is so absurd mixing thriller crime supernatural and horror and even a romantic end in a non sense way the acting is the worst possible highlighting the horrible performance of the beautiful elvire audrey john saxon just gives his name to the credits and works less than five minutes when his character is killed the special effects are limited to maggots everywhere the direction is ridiculous i lost a couple of hours of my life watching assassinio al cimitero etrusco if you have the desire or curiosity of seeing this trash choose another movie go to a pizzeria watch tv go sleep navigate in internet go to the gym but do not waste your time like i did my vote is two title brazil o mist rio etrusco the etruscan mystery i went to see this film with a great deal of excitement as i was at school with the director he was even a good friend of mine for a while but sorry mate this film stinks i can only talk about what was wrong with the first half because that s when i walked out and went to the pub for a much needed drink someone s standing on a balcony about to jump and so you send a helicopter to shine a searchlight on them i don t think so nothing would make them more likely to jump local radio doesn t send reporters to cover people about to attempt suicide again for fear of pressuring them into jumping or for fear of encouraging copy cat instances whatever the circumstances radio reporters don t do live broadcasts from the th floor of a tower block radio cars don t carry leads long enough to connect the microphone and headphones to the transmitter the stuck in the lift scene was utterly derivative the acting and direction was almost non existent i could go on but i won t yes i agree with everyone on this site this movie is very very bad to even call this a movie is an insult to all movies ever made it s minutes long someone compares this movie to an after school special b i n g o that describes is perfectly the packaging for this movie intentionally is misleading for example the title of this movie should describe the movie rubberface that should be the first hint it was retitled with a new package of some goofy face jim probably made in his stand up days i was hoping for more stand up from jim if you like jim now as an actor you would love him in his stand up days still trying to locate the rodney dangerfield young comedians special from hbo that featured jim in his early career days it isn t even mentioned on this site i d love to find anything jim did stand up wise also jim carrey is a supporting actor in this movie the main character is very very annoying she is some girl lacking self confidence but yet wants to be a stand up comedian jim is there to say lines like that s funny janet and you really are talented and honestly she is terrible really terrible and the movie is terrible beware of false advertising and a really bad movie jennifer ehle was sparkling in pride and prejudice jeremy northam was simply wonderful in the winslow boy with actors of this caliber this film had to have a lot going for it even those who were critical of the movie spoke of the wonderful sequences involving these two i was eager to see it it is with bitter disappointment however that i must report that this flick is a piece of trash the scenes between ehle and northam had no depth or tenderness or real passion they consisted of hackneyed and unsubtle latter day cinematic lust voracious open mouthed kissing and soft porn humping lust can be entertaining if it s done with originality this was tasteless and awful ehle and northam have sullied their craft they should be ashamed as for the modern part of the romance i was unnerved by the effeminate appearance of the male lead aren t there any masculine men left in hollywood the plot was kind of interesting with a better script and a more imaginative director it might have worked amy poehler is a terrific comedian on saturday night live but her role in this movie doesn t give her anything to work with her character a publisher s representative guiding a new author on a book tour is mean not funny susan sarandon plays the author s mother who is involved with the sadistic gym teacher billy bob thorton the author had when he was a chubby junior high student unfortunately her role doesn t require a talented actress the funniest thing is the way she looks in the awful gown she wears as the queen of the corn festival there is no explanation of why the corn queen is old enough to have a grown son the plot is the stale one of an author who wrote a best selling self help book and then adopts behavior that contradicts his advice still it is not the worst movie i ve ever seen and i didn t erase it before watching it a plane carrying employees of a large biotech firm including the ceo s daughter goes down in thick forest in the pacific northwest when the search and rescue mission is called off the ceo harlan knowles lance henriksen puts together a small ragtag group to execute their own search and rescue mission but just what is knowles searching for and trying to rescue and just what is following and watching them in the woods oy what a mess this film was it was a shame because for one it stars lance henriksen who is one of my favorite modern genre actors and two it could have easily been a decent film it suffers from two major flaws and they re probably both writer director jonas quastel s fault this film which i ll be calling by its aka of sasquatch has just about the worst editing i ve ever seen next to alone in the dark and quastel s constant advice for the cast appears to have been okay let s try that again but this time i want everyone to talk on top of each other improvise non sequiturs and generally try to be as annoying as possible the potential was there despite the rip off aspects any material related to the plane crash was obviously trying to crib the blair witch project and any material related to the titular monster was cribbing predator ed wood like exposition and ridiculous dialogue the plot had promise and potential for subtler and far less saccharine subtexts the monster costume once we actually get to see it was more than sufficient for my tastes the mixture of character types trudging through the woods could have been great if quastel and fellow writer chris lanning would have turned down the stereotype notch from to at least and spent more time exploring their relationships the monster s lair had some nice production design specifically the corpse decorations ala a more primitive jeepers creepers if it had been edited well there were some scenes with decent dialogue that could have easily been effective but the most frightening thing about sasquatch is the number of missteps made for some reason quastel thinks it s a good idea to chop up dialogue scenes that occur within minutes of each other in real time so that instead we see a few lines of scene a then a few lines of scene b then back to a back to b and so on for some reason he thinks it s a good idea to use frequently use black screens in between snippets of dialogue whether we need the idea of an unspecified amount of time passing between irrelevant comments or whether the irrelevant comments seem to be occurring one after the other in time anyway for some reason he doesn t care whether scenes were shot during the morning afternoon middle of the night etc he just cuts to them at random for that matter the scenes we re shown appear to be selected at random important events either never or barely appear and we re stuck with far too many pointless scenes for some reason he left a scene about cave art in the film when it either needs more exposition to justify getting there or it needs to just be cut out because it s not that important the monster s intelligence and humanity could have easily been shown in another way for some reason there is a whole character mary mancini left in the script even though she s superfluous for some reason we suddenly go to a extremely soft core porno scene even though the motif is never repeated again for some reason characters keep calling harlan knowles mr h like they re stereotypes of asian domestics for some reason quastel insists on using the blurry cam and distorto cam for the monster attack scenes even though the costume doesn t look that bad and it would have been much more effective to put in some fog a subtle filter or anything else other than bad cinematography i could go on but you get the idea i really wanted to like this film better than i did i m a henriksen fan i m intrigued by the subject i loved the setting i love hiking and this is basically a hiking film on one level but i just couldn t every time i thought it was going to be better from this point until the end quastel made some other awful move in the end my score was a out of a well made gritty science fiction movie it could be lost among hundreds of other similar movies but it has several strong points to keep it near the top for one the writing and directing is very solid and it manages for the most part to avoid many sci fi cliches though not all of them it does a good job of keeping you in suspense and the landscape and look of the movie will appeal to sci fi fans if you re looking for a masterpiece this isn t it but if you re looking for good old fashioned post apoc gritty future in space sci fi with good suspense and special effects then this is the movie for you thoroughly enjoyable and a good ending incredibly dumb and utterly predictable story of a rich teen girl who not given love by her parents starts a girl gang they rob gas stations rape guys and kill a policeman all the teenagers in this film are easily in their late s early s the acting is all horrible and the script has every cliche imaginable with hilarious dialogue it comes as no surprise that it was written by the immortal ed wood jr worth seeing for laughs best lines they re shooting back and it ain t supposed to be like this after reading the comments for this movie i am not sure whether i should be angry sad or sickened seeing comments typical of people who a know absolutely nothing about the military or b who base everything they think they know on movies like this or on cnn reports about abu gharib makes me wonder about the state of intellectual stimulation in the world at the time i type this the number of people in the us military million on active duty with another almost in the guard and reserves for a total of roughly million the number of people indicted for abuses at at abu gharib currently less than that makes the total of people indicted of the total military even if you indict every single military member that ever stepped in to abu gharib you would not come close to making that a whole number the flaws in this movie would take years to cover i understand that it s supposed to be sarcastic but in reality the writer and director are trying to make commentary about the state of the military without an enemy to fight in reality the us military has been at its busiest when there are not conflicts going on the military is the first called for disaster relief and humanitarian aid missions when the tsunami hit indonesia devestating the region the us military was the first on the scene when the chaos of the situation overwhelmed the local governments it was military leadership who looked at their people the same people this movie mocks and said make it happen within hours food aid was reaching isolated villages within days airfields were built cargo aircraft started landing and a food distribution system was up and running hours and days not weeks and months yes there are unscrupulous people in the us military but then there are in every walk of life every occupation but to see people on this website decide that million men and women are all criminal with nothing on their minds but thoughts of destruction or mayhem is an absolute disservice to the things that they do every day one person on this website even went so far as to say that military members are in it for personal gain wow entry level personnel make just under an hour assuming a hour work week of course many work much more than hours a week and those in harm s way typically put in hour days for months on end that makes the pay well under minimum wage so much for personal gain i beg you please make yourself familiar with the world around you go to a nearby base get a visitor pass and meet some of the men and women you are so quick to disparage you would be surprised the military no longer accepts people in lieu of prison time they require a minimum of a ged and prefer a high school diploma the middle ranks are expected to get a minimum of undergraduate degrees and the upper ranks are encouraged to get advanced degrees it s hard to describe elfen lied to someone who hasn t heard of it the closest i can think of is a strange mix of extreme violence romance and drama to those of you who haven t witnessed it you re probably wondering how these are all incorporated into the one piece coherently those that have though are instead pondering why they haven t been put together sooner such is the quality and flow of this odd hybrid of an anime the real area that elfen lied shines is it s narrative its hard not to be enthralled by its weaving course and diversity a violent and gory encounter will perhaps gives way to another with a contrasting lighter moment emotive drama gives way to bloodshed and then back again only this time bring you close to tears as it does so it s a strange combination where you as the viewer are thrown about and manipulated like those in the story line itself but one that works surprisingly well it does this all the while without feeling disjointed it has an elegance and clever subtly when it makes these strong transitions that makes it all the more mesmorising this is carefully finished with a truly memorable musical score which in my opinion is another great strength the opening lilium is particularly powerful and differing versions feature prominently throughout lending its intensity to emotive scenes however regarding music there s an off kilter over happy pop song that plays over the credits after each episode it feels out of place but never the less is adequate enough and it could be argued adds a good contrast to what is at times quite a depressing anime i must reiterate however that the violence is somewhat extreme and i advise you to be prepared for it if you are faint hearted however by no means avoid this because of it there s a lot more to it than the violence and you will be denying yourself a truly wondrous experience by not watching it it is to any fan of the medium unmissable a weird cocktail of conflicting ideas that on paper shouldn t work but some how is pulled off in spectacular fashion gripping you from the start to it s brutal conclusion still not convinced well ask yourself this is there anything else out there that can lay claim to being disturbing and yet at the same time profoundly beautiful it s worth watching on that premise alone of all the bile inducing vomitoriums to squeeze out of tinseltown s bloody sphincter over the past years this is indisputably the worst of the lot carvey s one man show is such a poor excuse for comedy that it doesn t even deserve to get raked by the mst crew i swear i actually felt nauseated after watching this festering pile of manure in order to lengthen the lame minute running time the producers padded the end credits to ten minutes with lame ass carvey impressions that surely couldn t even make the last few minutes of that god awful saturday night live tv show in it you can see carvey imitating other notable actors who surely don t deserve the indignity did i mention it features jessica simpson in a cameo yech if you ever plan on watching this stinking puke fest you might want to make sure you have plenty of pepto bisthmol beforehand this is quite an underrated hitchcock movie while its not one of his best movies this is actually quite good the plot is very world war inspired so that may be part of why it is overlooked this does have classic hitchcock suspense moments though although the best one comes towards the end a lot of dialogue here too and tallulah bankhead does an excellent job worth checking out if you are a fan being a huge gary oldman fan i had high hopes for this film and the deleverence straw dogs esquire story about an english couple vacationing at their friends house in a remote part of spain where they find a poor child locked away in chains and have to face the wraith of local villagers started off well enough it had some good atmosphere and it kept my attention however sadly it seems to run out of steam and lose it s direction somewhere along the way i felt my interest waning as the story seemed to limp along to an extremely unsatisfying ending however at that point i no longer cared it is always cool to see oldman though my grade c eye candy virginie ledoyen aitana s nchez gij n both bare all lion s gate region dvd extras trailers for the eye remake retribution christie s revenge dead man s bounty blood trails and a promo for fear net for the most part the acting was poorly done especially on part of the park ranger and the stories were anything but scary predictable and rather poorly shot even if there was a low budget the idea for this movie was a good one it just wasn t pulled off ram gopal varma does it again yet another movie which draws you into the reality of underworld and introduces you to the machinery of mumbai underworld d is a story of a young aggressive man deshu who gets into the underworld and changes the orthodox ways of its operation he defies the ongoing practices and with his courage he is in the driving seat just after some time he joins the gang randeep hooda comes as a surprise this young chap from haryana delivers a performance which is really amazing last time when we saw randeep hooda he was in a small appearance in monsoon wedding but this movie shows his potential he resembles to chandu of company but definitely does it better than vivek oberoi satya and company were on the same lines of d but definitely satya is the best among the three d company music wise is not up to the mark but songs are hardly part of the story performance wise the movie is a full of good performances chunky pandey gives a great performance and fits to the role then there are artists like goga kapoor sushant singh who can never go wrong isha kopikar had very little scope but her costumes and body language was perfect for the small time when she was on screen if you enjoyed satya and company this movie is a sure go for you don t expect any mercy from varma productions because there is ample of on screen violence and tension like the previous two flicks i gave it for some attempt at historical detail to echo another reviewer all the actors behave as in the th st centuries not the victorian th the actors behave far too freely and with hardly any attempt at the formal dignity stiff social restraint of the time and no apparent attempt to represent the social mores and customs of the era watch the original version with ralph richardson to see what i m driving at or watch zulu zulu dawn or charge of the light brigade for more authentic historical recreation of how people were in those days the battle scenes in this version may have been fierce but the pacing was far too th century even warfare was a more formal and dignified affair then than it is today it took the first world war to change that if you want th st century romance and military heroics transposed to the th century this film is ok for anything more historically real best look elsewhere i wanted to watch this one sense i am a fan of films such as last house on the left and maniac this film follows in this same gener only less satisfying to watch than those above this movie is about a garage worker who leads a double life as a serial rapeist watching young women and taking advantage of them at the apropriate moment he stutters when he s with a girl and starts to feel nervous which i felt was unapprpriate for the movie then we see him making his move towards the victim and them the movie switches to a different scene and then later on in the movie like when we see the killer watching tv or drinking a beer or scratching his rabbit which is his only friend we see flashbacks of what happened between the killer and the unfortunate victim which we should have seen while he was killing the victim this i also found unnecisary in the movie the part that i did like in the movie as compared to maniac was the fact that we get to see what the killers thinking and just why he commits these murders and i liked that always wanted to know just what made those serial killers tick but this one didn t tick to much for me i gave it a che is a good film for chronicling the events leading to the cuban revolution and certainly has a mystic potency surrounding che and his political ideals however there is no emotional core or compassionate deliverance to make this anything more than interesting and is a friendly inspection of che s mindset rather than anything inspiring the events in che offer insight into guerrilla warfare but it fails to capture the imagination much of the score in che is over dramatic and frictional to the narrative it tries to up the tempo but it comes across as rather willful and disjointed as the war continues comrades die and characters which you have been deliberately introduced to perish without a second glance the biggest failure for che is that it does not have any emotional engagement with its characters it is happy to leisurely move through the film che is a likable film but it does not grip or pull at your heartstrings the film is well made but it is a film produced almost with an educational edge rather than exploring che and his revolutionaries with any passion it glides steadily along to an ending well suited to its purpose this film is very disturbing it reminded me of the love and affection and materialistic things that we all want for ourselves it s a movie about how fame fortune and a notion of that being rich will make your life better might end up destroying you it s been almost years since the films release and yet today it remain as relevant as ever as still the biggest stars in the world gets destroyed for the exact same reasons as displayed in the film britney spears and michael jackson comes to mind like norma in the film these people are kings but no amount of money or fame can save them from their own destruction and that is the tragedy and yet the world goes on and we keep dreaming about fame and fortune will we ever learn this film disturbs me it s like looking into the state of mind of human beliefs we all wanna be pop stars and drive around in fancy cars we do think it will make us more happy will it norma viii x let me put it this way i love bad movies i pretty much grew up with mst k since i was about i often rent cheesy horror and action films for a good laugh this movie made the original godzilla movies look like oscar worthy films they even try to make their monster seem more powerful and more impressive with the line this guy makes godzilla look like a pussy well at least any godzilla films japan or usa versions has better plots and acting the special effects were awful a special effect is supposed to blend in to make creature or other objects look like they are real the special effects in this film stick out big time i would not wish this film on anyone stars out of from the combined ministries of jack and rexella van impe and john hagee comes revelation the second in a trilogy of films about somebody s conception of the end times i say somebody s because even fundamentalist christians are by no means united about prophesying things to come i ve not seen the first of these films apocalypse in which a united world government is established and the rapture has taken place a guy who even calls himself the messiah named macaluso played by nick mancuso has taken over the world and it s either his way or the highway christians are not even united on whether there will even be a rapture but i m of the opinion that if the fundamentalists are right and whole lots of people that you know feel that way suddenly vanish it might give some tangible proof about the bible being real but it has happened and it s happened to jeff fahey s family wife and daughter who just vanished without a trace she could never quite get him to church and he s been left behind as a result anyway under the regime of messiah macaluso those who are not followers of his are deemed haters and are rounded up and also disappear in more conventional ways fahey finds himself questioning what s going on and when he does he s framed for his partner s murder and forced to flee among the haters who in his city include former news anchor leigh lewis who in the first film had been the first to denounce macaluso for being satan mancuso s got something called a day of wonders where folks will be asked to participate in a virtual reality game en masse since we know who mancuso is it s something not good and its up to the believer types to throw a monkey wrench into the works carol alt and tony nappo play a blind and a paraplegic people respectively and when they play the game they are healed and become mancuso s disciples that s a mighty hard thing to give up healing from some affliction to reject mancuso david roddis has an over the top performance as one of mancuso s acolytes who s playing his villain in the best snidely whiplash tradition all he needed was a handlebar mustache to twirl at both ends it s impossible to evaluate these films because believer folk will hang on every word and nonbelievers will inevitably scoff then it degenerates into a theological not a cinema discussion the cast give it their best to inject reality in some far fetched notions there was a scene that really wasn t terribly germane to the plot where a father turns in his son for re education because he caught him with a bible i took a look on the actor darrel hicks who played the son and found he d also later done work on queer as folks talk about an eclectic resume the ending is positively biblical itself just think of shadrach meshach and abednego ghost world is one of the better teen or comming of age movie i have seen in a while the story was very sweet and it gives people who are hopeless like myself hope this is because the ugly but unique dork of the movie gets to find true love i don t usually see that in todays moviesthe movie consists of many interesting characters and the actors who played the characters did an outstanding job especially thora birch and steve buscemi the settings in the movie was good and i liked how the movie used different room colors for different occasions in this movie there are some problems of this movie the movie was a little bit long and sometimes the story drags scarlett johanson character seemed pretty small it would be nice to more a little bit of scarlett johanson character this movie was funny sweet and interesting if you are sick of the ordinary teen movies you should watch this interesting little teen movie called ghost world outstanding film dealing with a year old who tries to bring stability to a totally dysfunctional family there is a truly outstanding performance by anne heche as the dysfunctional mother who neglects her children to lead a most disgusting life in pursuit of a good time heche is ably supported by diane ladd a religious woman who can quote the bible but could not control her rebellious daughter the film deals with how a sharp year old has to learn to play the system to keep her brothers together bright perceptive and unfortunately victimized by a sick mother kristen bell gives a splendid performance i enjoyed the part where she meets a black young man who becomes her boyfriend nothing is made of the inter racial relationship nor the fact that the young man has a black father and white mother this film shows that a court system can work to the advantage of its victims this movie did play like a dream or maybe even like an autobiography it was disjointed it was basically a bunch of mostly random scenes throughout this lady s life and you wonder what is going to happen next to her the scenery was beautiful but that is the only redeeming value i could find wait for it to come to tv this film is supposedly based on the true account of a prisoner who escaped from devil s island in french guiana however the book by henri charriere about his experiences apparently has a lot of inconsistencies and outright fabrications a polite way of saying he was a liar so provided you understand that this isn t quite a true story this is still an exceptional film much of this is due to incredible acting direction scripting and makeup henri charriere played by steve mcqueen is going to devil s island for killing a pimp supposedly in self defense on the boat he meets a swindler played by dustin hoffman and they become friends most of the film documents how harsh and awful life is in the prison came either in the work camps or when living in solitary confinement all take their toll and kill off many of the prisoners by charriere is resilient despite all these privations he never loses his resolve to escape though hoffman eventually does and accepts his life on the island after one failed escape attempt in the end charriere does escape though in real life this apparently did not occur while there is a lot more to the movie and what i have mentioned after all it s a very long and involved film the full impact of the story is not what you read but seeing the awfulness of the prison so be prepared for a movie that at times is very difficult to watch but is constructed it s an amazing film i know that cartoons aimed towards adults generally don t get the attention they deserve because they get written off as childish or don t capture interests as quickly as attractive famous real life characters can but please give this show a chance i promise that just one episode of this show will have you hooked i haven t laughed out loud this much since arrested development r i p and the humor is similarly fast paced and at times absurd the show is a half hour long divided into two minute episodes which makes the show very watchable even for people who don t think they can devote an entire minutes to a cartoon everything about this show is hilarious the scenarios the dry dialogue the buildup to inevitable madness and the horribly drawn but wonderfully fleshed out characters the show follows tim who is frequently caught in admittedly outlandish situations although they always seem to spiral out of control so realistically he and the supporting cast of characters all have their own stand out performances including debbie the friend hooker and amy the girlfriend who is perpetually disappointed in her well meaning but just plain awful boyfriend so before you write it off simply because it s an adult cartoon watch just one episode hell even watch one half of an episode that s minutes of your time that will quickly lead to you watching every episode i promise but what a disappointment the acting was superb the cinematography was gorgeous the stimulated sex particularly the gay stuff quite hot however the characters were totally unbelievable as everything was driven by plot line nothing by the characters surely to g d this was not the first time campbell scott s character had stepped out on his wife so she must have known something was going on he would have been clever enough to ensure she never found out we are led to believe she is naive to the ways of the world and yet knows to how to find and hire a private detective and gather enough information to gaslight another person so cleverly this compassionate woman suddenly turns into a total freak and the up and coming scuse the pun screenwriter is supposed to be a man of the world and yet believes his dead lover speaks to him in a computer chat room the whole thing about the poisonous plants gee can you say foreshadowing we rented the dvd and i left the room to do other things about half an hour before the end because i simply could not waste my time any longer as a long time holmes fan and particularly of the jeremy brett interpretations i was fully prepared to dislike this one intensely however i did enjoy it and can recommend it though with some warnings as several have mentioned the time warp is annoying for those who know the genre while it s certainly possible that holmes might have come out of retirement at a young age this is pushing it a bit far holmes and watson were at least in their mid to late twenties in the s so an edwardian setting would have them each pushing i don t recall seeing this everett guy before but i think they could have done better however after seeing poor charlton heston doing holmes i won t squawk too loudly everett seems to play up the jaded effeminate edwardian dandy routine a bit much for me aside from the earlier mentioned telephone disparity and perhaps too routine use of fingerprints i was particularly aggravated by the reference at the end to james whistler s famous work commonly known as whistler s mother holmes refers to it as something like portrait in gray whereas the actual title is arrangement in gray and black or black and gray if as screenwriter is determined to be that pretentious he should at least do the research and get it right the plot seemed to be cheating a bit to me too as others have mentioned but i did like it warts and all maybe a or out of in two sentimental movie so alike was make one is this and the other is simon birch both are about the boy tried to make a different in this world despite the fact that they are disable this movie star elden henson as the boy with disturb past and kieran culkin as the disable boy they two become friend and that when imaginary adventure begin the movie also consist of many a lister star such as gena rowlands sharon stone gillian anderson meat loaf and james gandolfini yes that is one hell of a cast but that doesn t really save this film anyway the movie is dreadful because by the end of the movie you ll wish you never seen it cause it is too slow and boring the script wasn t that bad at all the character is well written but the situation is boring and dreadful and the sentimental stuff was overdone that it end up being really cheesy the acting wasn t all bad but the set was boring and unimaginative and the lighting and cinematography didn t do a good job it as if the film was shot decades back reason to watch better not watch it reason not to you won t miss a thing feel like waste of electricity watching it rating grade f please rate y n after reading thanks many of you have posted comments on clockwatchers as a portrayal of office life not true it is a movie based on each of the main characters personal identity struggle and nothing more than that watch it again and forget that they are in an office setting focus on the personalities you see in each of the main characters i ll give you a hint lisa kudrow s character has bulimia nervosa guess who has ocd never ignore the obvious and never over look the obscure a great movie stars for years friends expressed amazement that i had never watched nip tuck just my kind of show they insisted and so spurred by the recent assault of pre season publicity i decided to pay a first time visit to nip tuck last night i was expecting sly and witty satire what i found instead in repeat episodes that focused on a serial mangler and a deranged racist was a puerile unrelenting torrent of violence and sadism robotic and or hysterical acting moronic plot contortions and enough deep shadow in miami yet to make edgar ulmer spin like a top it was like watching joel schumacher direct ricky martin as hannibal lecter nice to know what my friends think of my taste st watched out of dir anthony hickox lame and silly attempt to spoof horror movies in this story about a possessed wax museum visited by brainless teenagers a couple of them get swept into the exhibits and the story that revolves around the exhibits and then they get killed and become permanent parts of it this is the basic storyline but they add a rule the world theme concocted by the leader of the museum he believes that once each exhibit has had it s chance to kill they will all come to life and conquer all mu ha ha the movie has a campiness that makes you think initially it will be a comedy but it really just turns into a slow moving horror movie the exhibits include the werewolf a vampire the marquis de sade and an alien that isn t really explored this is where the movie tries to pay tribute to these type of movies but fails at least the movie didn t turn out to be a kill all teens slasher movie and they tried a different style in the storytelling to put away the worthless teenagers but it still doesn t really work as an interesting movie i thank the heavens for mst otherwise this movie would have been intolerable it is a communal pain distributed among the watchers first of all the protagonist is dr neil connery played by neil connery subtle neil is sean connery s brother you would not guess that from the great acting displayed in this movie this movie is simply an italian knock off of a james bond movie except you couldn t afford any of the trademarks they also managed to get some people who actually stared in bond movies like ms moneypenny lois maxwell m bernard lee and emilio largo from thunderball played by adolfo celi thats about where all the similarities to any bond movie end where james bond has a suave debonair style and uses various gadgets his brother neil user hypnosis and the jerry lewis approach it s not that he is clumsy he just seems to be uncomfortable with women the plot is pretty bad and nonsensical by far the best part of the movie is the end conflict where neil and friends fight largo s minions who dress like the aliens from v red vinyl outfits with the helmets from the fireman of fahrenheit not only that but they are all shooting underwater harpoons exciting isn t it this all leads to the duel between largo aka thair beta and neil harpoons at paces this movie is bad please don t watch this movie unless you are heavily medicated the gore in this film was good thats about all the good i can say about this film i see others saying the acting was good when i read other reviews on this film and i only have to say one thing about that what are you people taking this was the worst acting i have ever seen and i have seen some really bad acting and the story ooh very bad there where to many hole in the script writing and everybody is raving about a surprise ending um mm people most film today are going into that direction of weird twisty endings it s being overdone all s i have to say about this film that seconds is seconds to long to watch it i was duped into thinking that this was an actual movie had i known it was a tv movie i would have spent the rental fee elsewhere the jacket of the movie made it look like it d be funny but i was wrong i didn t even laugh once during the entire flick and i m a person who laughs during a funny movie even if its as stupid as watching wiley e coyote blowing himself up others may say this is a good family movie but i wouldn t even let my own kids watch this movie this must be one of the most refreshing surprises i saw in a long time looks boring but it s ultrahilarious in documentary style we learn something about australia s dirty history well this is a satire so don t check out the net for verification okay we go back in the early fifties at where we find an australian communist joan fraser judy davis who really would give her life for the red star it goes so far that she can arrange to meet the man stalin himself all of course before the public knew of his slaughters and what joan never expected she ends up in bed with stalin but as the man is walking on his last feet he dies agent nine sam neil tells her she s a hero who saved russia and that same night she also ends up in his bed not knowing what to do joan returns to australia finding out that she is pregnant she doesn t tell her australian boyfriend who the father of her child is but the poor b d accepts but soon trouble happens when agent nine returns to the land of the kangaroos cos the question is who is the father he or stalin things of hilarious things are following and we follow the days of the child joe welch richard roxburgh for communist mum he s a perfect child always to be seen at manifestations against the vietnamwar but then the nightmare strikes joe falls in love with a female cop really it s totally hilarious even if the personages always stay sober but it s the kind of script that leaves you not one minute in silence a perfect film from a rather unknown director see it great film i have this film got it off sky sum time and yes its freeky as hell there s no blood no swearing and sorry to those people that want to see it but no nudity well its censored anyway i thought this film was real when i first seen it and i couldn t go anywhere alone i became paranoid that the aliens were gonna come get me i think this film is psychological and really gets to you evan thought this film was fake some say it actually happened and this was the remake ethier way it still freaks me out to this day not as much but i get those shiverer s down my back when i watch it ps this film has names as far as i no alien abduction incident in lake county and alien abduction the macpherson tape if you no of any others or the real tape please say my local video rental store is eliminating all of their vhs tapes and as i am still trapped in the s and do not have a dvd player i was more than happy to take some off their hands pick in choosing my for kindergarden ninja has proved to be just as the others have said the most entertaining use of a dollar you can find i hardly know where to begin lets start with the cover of the movie it is important to note that the creators in no way intended you to think there were real martial arts in this film ninja in the title is in quotation as if to warn you of the fighting skills the cover also declares say no to drugs that s what got me interested in this film but the best part is inside at one part in the film blade steel ex nfl star dwight clark suggests that he and his date go to clark s on the bay dwight clark real life restaurant as he says this the number to make a reservation at his his restaurant scrolls across the bottom of the screen as they have their meal steel goes on stage to sing the motown hit miles from home while on stage his date is suddenly kidnapped by ninjas while continuing to hold the mic and sing steel defeats the ninjas and returns to the stage with a wink during the final fight scene steel his martial arts mentor and for a few brief seconds used as a weapon the kindergarten children fight a clan of drug dealing ninjas who throughout the film had been played by children but are now mysteriously grown men during this action scene slow motion is actually filmed by the actors moving in slow motion simply amazing the entire film is packed full of gems like this i doubt you ll ever be able to find this film but if you do please pick it up it will definitely be worth the dollar you spend to everyone reading the comments here as your well wisher i recommend not to see this movie i don t want to write anything about it some sensible people who have posted comments here and given a deserved bad review about it have already pointed out all the flaws of this movie i just want to save a long good period of frustration and anger which i went through after watching it what a waste of a talented budding actor like vivek oberoi i pity him really i am so embarrassed i have to give a rating of to this movie i thought would be there but it is not there so i am forced to give a rating of as far as the good reviews for this movie here are concerned i am surprised and shocked these good reviews here lead me to the imagination of s ghai or someone handsomely paid by him sitting spending some valuable hours cooking up false stories about this movie being great etcthants all the absolute worst of the trilogy not even comedy could save it unrealistic unbelievable loud sudden sounds the only scary component really should have quit after one no two was bad but not in the ball park compared to this disaster nev campbell the only saving grace with the four votes given placed solely on her performance having to work under atrocious conditions fletch is at again but this time the premise is extremely worn out and the wisecracks are very tired and sometimes downright stupid it started so promising when fletch finds out that he has inherited an estate in the deep south from an aunt he hardly knew we get a wicked satire of song of the south complete with animation and a singing chevy when the scenery changes from l a to lousiana we get every southern stereotype known to man the klan is apparently back in action and tries to get fletch to leave the estate which turns out to be not what it s cracked up to be we also get southern beauties who present themselves with three names like amanda ray ross and becky ann culpepper and you just know that the first thing fletch does is make a rather suggestive remark that the women find irresistible and they immediately jump in the sack with him the amanda ray character is not so lively the next morning and looks sort of like she was in the deep freeze for the entire night can this be a comment on fletch s abilities in the sack or is there foul play involved if you think it is the second answer you are absolutely right so next we meet a lawyer who seems to wanna help fletch do they do that and we also meet a ranch hand who serves as fletch s only friend among hostile citizens an amusing but not quite funny bit involves a tv evangelist played by the great r lee ermey but he doesn t seem sleazy enough to generate much suspicion towards him so the real culprit must be the most unlikely have i given too much away doesn t matter the plot is not why we go to see this movie but the laughs are not there this time a shame since i was looking forward to seeing this you can only hope that there won t be another sequel one of tennessee williams best plays becomes a good but not great film despite a stellar cast it s hard to pin exactly why this film doesn t soar but it s a solid screen version maybe it s just that the subject matter works better in a stage environment and that the camera is just too intimate familiar story of restless son his crippled sister and their manic mother who seems to live in the golden past is great material for the stage and this sad story of the mother s attempts to goad the son into bringing home a young man to meet the sister seems rather cruel but even the forgotten and lost can lead lives of desperation as they cling to dreams and make wishes on silver moons arthur kennedy stars as tom the son who tries to please his mother but longs to escape his dull job in st louis and see the world jane wyman is the crippled sister who has shrunk from the world and collects tiny glass animals gertrude lawrence is the mother who was abandoned by her husband and has been reduced to living in a dumpy apartment and selling magazine subscriptions and kirk douglas is the gentleman caller all actors are quite good although none received oscar nominations despite the hype many great actresses have been associated with the role of amanda wingfield since this play made its broadway debut in the s laurette taylor katharine hepburn joanne woodward maureen stapletobm jessica tandy julie harris and jessica lange have all played the role on stage film or tv and i swear i remember shirley booth doing this on tv also ultimetaely the story is as fragile as the glass figures if any one character dominates the story the whole play collapses this film version works very well in balancing the roles and while wyman seems a tad old for the part lawrence was an even odder choice i ve also read that bette davis and tallulah bankhead were considered but how they decided on lawrence a great musical comedy star in london and new york is anyone s guess she really is quite good but the film might have need the extra star power of bette davis anyway this classic american play is worth watching calling this movie one of the best dutch in recent years is perhaps not enough it certainly deserves a spot among the best dutch movies of all time as well if i had to compare this movie to any other i would say that this movie is the dutch glengarry glen ross it has only powerhouse actors in it the movie doesn t just have one main character it follows multiple story lines from all the different characters and it has an excellent written story don t let the fact that this is just a made for tv movie scare you of the only reason the movie didn t got a theatrical release is because dutch cinema in general is not very popular by the main stream audience and besides movies like this just don t do well in dutch cinema s regardless of the language spoken a shame because that also in a way means that not too often dutch movies like cloaca will ever be made and released this movie however truly screams for more the story at first starts of rather simple but just like in real life things are more complicated than they at first seem every character in the movie has problem s on their own and the one thing that connects everything is their friendship the four old college buddies now in their forties try to help each other but have to cope with their own difficulties as well by helping each other out they discover the true meaning of friendship and start evaluation the way their lives are progressing thus far and where things went wrong for them and they let the good old times revive as well it s a real character movie and a movie like this always requires some extremely good actors cloaca really has this it makes the movie the story and the situations in this all feel very real and understandable cloaca has the best acting you ll probably ever see in a dutch movie all of the actors in this movie are well taught and established actors who appear mostly on the stage it s too bad that dutch movies not too often give the chance to let actors like this shine on the silver screen ductch cinema doesn t often offer roles like these to actors of this caliber pierre bokma gijs scholten van aschat and pierre bokma are all probably the best dutch actors at the moment it also definitely helps the movie that the three of them are real life friends and went to college together along with the movie its director willem van de sande bakhuyzen it definitely shows on screen since they all have such a great chemistry and share some great anticipation and reaction with each other it lifts their performances to an even higher level and makes the timing spot on the movie is deliberately kept low key no fancy tricks are used and the movie mostly relies on telling its story purely through its characters it s based on a stage play by maria goos which starred for most part the same actors that also appear in this movie it means that the movie also feels stagey at times with its characters and dialog this doesn t always work out well in movies but there are exceptions and when there are exceptions they are always brilliant ones cloaca is a wonderful example of this it s a real shame by the way that the british kevin spacey stage play version wasn t an huge success the movie is extremely well directed by willem van de sande bakhuyzen of course the storytelling is slow but van de sande bakhuyzen s directing keeps the pace always high and the movie interesting the movie also has some beautiful cinematography and a suiting musical score a real lost for dutch cinema that willem van de sande bakhuyzen died in of cancer he made the best movies in his last years and i would had definitely been interested in seeing more movies of him definitely if they were like cloaca to comment on this movie there are two main sides first one would be adam sandler i have always liked his movies for the light kind of comedy he presents you watch and you laugh but you don t expect to come out of the movie with a deeper message or something remotely philosophic to think about i find that when adam sandler tries to go deep his movies become quite depressing and nonsensical click quickly comes to mind the thing about the zohan is that i laughed a lot in some parts but i find his affairs with the older ladies to be a bit repetitive and leaning towards downright boring also the crude language and the oh too much crotch view makes it quite impossible to let your kids watch the movie which is a pity because i find the hilarious fight scenes and the zohan s supernatural cool stunts would have been fun for kids to watch second point of view would be from an arab point of view i started watching this movie preparing myself to get offended and mind you i am a very broad minded person however i was pleasantly surprised for the first time in my life i see a movie that does not picture arabs as animal like heartless brainless killing machines they are just people trying to make a living even the avenging one has a reason the zohan stole his goat watching this movie i tried to forget that i am an arab and i see that it is portraying in a very silly and somehow inaccurate way two opposing sides and suggesting that they stop fighting get over their differences to see that they are in fact similar the movie makers get my personal thank you for that it is no different than watching a movie about the conflict between black and white people after the civil war or about americans and japanese directly after wwii there is no prejudices against arabs here for the very first time someone has discovered that arabs are human beings too so thank you man without a star has to be one film the former issur danielovitch must surely wish he could erase from his resume douglas plays a ne er do well ranch hand who ends up switching sides during a range war among two big cattle ranches jeanne crain is the boss lady of the ranch he starts out on and you can almost feel the beginnings of the big valley in this largely awful western from the s outfitted in stylish form fitting shirts douglas is simply terrible as the conflicted cowpoke talk about miscasting crain isn t bad as the boss lady but she s no barbara stanwyck a veritable army of familiar supporting players including jay c flippen can barely keep this turkey afloat the script stinks the direction is aimless the cinematography is wasted if this was the kind of movie intended to keep viewers away from their tvs i can t imagine it succeeded in doing so even though i understand it was a box office hit in its time big wednesday endless summer there is no real way to compare the two however since endless summer is a documentary that follows a couple of california surfers as they search out the perfect waves around the world big wednesday is the story of guys as they come of age together and culminates in an actual big wave day that happened at malibu the characters are guys almost any surfer from the late s and early s can relate to because of the bonding that would take place on the water back then surfing wasn t about the big buck tournaments they have now it was time well spent with your compadres and the film reflected that time remake this movie i hope not because it captured the essence of the california beach scene then and william katt gary busey and jan michael vincent portrayed very typical california surfers of the time and it would be almost impossible to capture that spirit again it s simply one of the worst movies i have ever seen it is hard to believe people put money and agreed to participate in such a puerile film this is a completely flawed after the end of the world film badly acted with cheap effects and a horrible filming nothing to keep you watching it excepting the fascination of how worse it can get and it gets worse as you watch it avoid it on my personal scale i just recently rented this title and it was great the story line contained issues from alcoholism marriage issues to the normal every day issues in the life of our great firefighters and the crazy things we do with our friends i know we ve all done a few of those here and there dj perry was awesome even considering this was his st starring role a few times he was running in this movie i was waiting for him to fall flat on his face he definitely kept it real i would of been running my butt off if i was being chased by that hideous creature all i can say is great writing directing and acting go out and watch it i have to agree what a really awful movie this was just a poor ripoff at a time when poor ripoffs weren t as common as now sigh the original westworld takes a good concept and works well the attempts to tie futureworld back to westworld are poorly structured wooden performances abound not just from the robots either watch westworld and skip the sequel another reasonable pick for an odd yul brenner movie is an odd post apocalyptic knife fighter flick aardvaark hide and seek is a really creepy psychological thriller directed by john polson mission impossible ii the sum of us and it has one of the most memorable and most shocking surprising endings ever another movie that had that creepy ending thing was wes craven s they sorry no other titles come to mind but see they it s extremely scary anyway robert deniro shark tale cape fear for once did not over act in this movie his acting was actually great and dakota fanning just literally blew me away she is definitely the best young actress that has ever been and that will ever be i hope i said that phrase right but if i didn t i m sure you know what ii mean she did the same thing in war of the worlds too she has a very very very very very very very rare gift of acting she has such a talent that god gave her she just passed through the part easily as if there was nothing too it her part as emily callaway really creeped me out she also won an mtv movie award for best frightened performance in this movie she really seemed actually frightened everything else was wonderful in this movie see hide and seek you won t be disappointed original mpaa rating r frightening sequences and violencemy mpaa rating r violence terror and frightening sequences my canadian rating a violence frigtening scenes mature theme again a french blockbuster i had in mind largo winch for our national action thriller tries and the feeling that something was lacking in comparison to james bond mission impossible or the recent traitor my opinion hasn t changed action isn t unforgettable the story is boring and the characters dull even before the troubles come the spies are depressive mournful i know the director wanted to show the crude reality of undercover action but he failed to tell something interesting even his commentary is lethargic it s a pity because some sequences show that he is talented with a camera the best moment of the movie is their vacations in casablanca because it was almost like mine in oujda another moroccan town streets filled with people red and whites taxis pool and another french dvd without subtitles i adore this movie mike myers is a comic genius i pretty much love all his movies but this one is one of the best even before it was hysterical for eddie murphy to play his whole family we had mike playing his own father and doing a darn good job of it too hollywood insider films have been made since the movie colony came out to the west coast the hollywood community was aware that the public knew their patented make believe was just that and so they were willing to share the truth about hollywood with the public fairly often but these films got darker in the late s and early s in billy wilder s sunset boulevard showed how the world had forgotten it s celebrities and stars of the late silent period a generation earlier in although ostensibly a comedy singing in the rain did show the disaster to so many silent careers even the detestable lila lamont s that sound brought in it s wake yet with all the viewing of the effect of the film industry s changes on the lives of actors few tackled that of production people vincent minelli s the bad and the beautiful did just that studying the career of a super film producer it s use of organized series of flashbacks reminds of that this film s producer was john houseman once the partner of orson welles in his mercury theater the constant comment that the anti hero of the film jonathan shields kirk douglas is dismissed as a genius is like the disparagement shown to boy genius welles when he showed up in hollywood but the basic model for the producer seems to be david o selznick whose father was prominent in the s until forced out by rivals in the industry jonathan s father was also a big shot until he too was thrown out by his rivals briefly the plot of the story is how shields made a career out of the work of other people several of whom he hurt by discarding as soon as he could first is his co producer director fred amiel barry sullivan whose treatment plan for a major film is taken from him by shields to sell the studio on backing it amiel hoped to direct it but it is directed instead by von ellstein ivan triesaut a kind of clone of josef von sternberg amiel breaks with shields as a result and never will work for him again however amiel is able within a few years to be one of the most successful hollywood directors anyway that incident was in a film preview is shown at a theater showing anna karenina with garbo and fredric march an mgm film just like this one in shields is casting the leading role for a film to be shot by harry whitfield leo g carroll possibly a clone of alfred hitchcock he decides to hire georgia lorison lana turner for the female lead opposite gaucho gilbert roland lorison is the daughter of a classic leading actor of the past his voice is heard it is louis calhern s who died impoverished and an alcoholic wreck the father and daughter are supposed to be john and diane barrymore georgia is trying to keep off the sauce herself and falls on the day shooting is to begin since jonathan learns that georgia loves him he romances her it is only when the film is in the can that he breaks it off rather roughly georgia s performance makes her a success in hollywood but she never will work for jonathan again finally we have the story of novelist james lee barlow dick powell and his wife rosemary gloria grahame barlow is in hollywood to write the screenplay version of his best selling novel of the deep south he s a clone for william faulkner and thomas wolfe with some f scott fitzgerald in as rosemary keeps james lee from working jonathan tries to get the author into isolation to work and preoccupies rosemary with gaucho who had come onto her at a party but gaucho and rosemary are killed in a plane crash james lee finishes the script but an argument between jonathan and von ellstein causes the latter to quit the film jonathan ruins the film because he has no talent as a director still he and james lee might work on a new project together but a stupid remark by jonathan causes james lee to realize that gaucho and rosemary were together on that ill fated trip due to jonathan so he too leaves the producer but subsequently he writes a novel about his wife and wins a pulitzer prize called together by jonathan s financial head harry pebble walter pidgeon the three victims of shields refuse a new offer for just one final picture with him but at the conclusion they all show curiosity on just what the new idea of his is the bad and the beautiful had a wonderful script it has many intricate bits in it that one has to catch on repeated viewings pebble originally shields boss dismisses him until he sees the treatment of the novel that amiel wrote he thinks it is shields ideas he says in front of a seething fred amiel he always thought shields a genius later of course he realizes it was not jonathan s work similarly von ellstein congratulates jonathan on being the first producer whose treatment of a book resembles the work of a director later he too realizes it was fred s work and ironically the collapse of jonathan s position is begun when von ellstein lectures jonathan on how you can t just stuff a film with a series of climaxes but have to build to one also the first time georgia and james lee discuss a film script they accidentally by lack of knowledge on his part and by temporary failure of memory on hers hurt each other without realizing it it becomes a rich tapestry of the industry and the various lives that get involved in it as such it is one of the best films about movie making ever made this has to be the worst film of the year possibly of any year doubly insulting that it s set in my home town what was it supposed to be satire social commentary a series of badly written sketches with no discernible story how anyone can watch this codswallop and not find themselves screaming at the screen is beyond me and to watch some decent actors struggle with this appalling script was agony i have to assume it was some sort of tax dodge for the scottish film industry no one with any understanding and or experience of film making would surely sanction such utter tripe for creative reasons and the director wins a scottish bafta who decided that the same people who funded it perchance it s no wonder no one outside of glasgow takes the scottish film industry seriously if this is perceived to be some sort of pinnacle the only sensible thing would be to have a bonfire with all existing prints on calton hill beside edinburgh s original disgrace update i ve just read that this unspeakable piece of rubbish also won a british comedy award beating the incredibles and sideways i think a steward s enquiry is required update i ve since spoken to a couple of people who were involved in this production and they both reported that no one seemed to know what they were doing and boy does it show the film made a mere at the uk box office i pray it wasn t released abroad great return on the k the uk film council wasted on it it s no wonder they re desperately trying to recoup their investment via dvd sales and rental makes you proud to be british doesn t it update three not that i m obsessed the comments of d g below are interesting i m inferring that we in the vast majority and not just on this site who thought this film had all the artistic merit of raw sewage have somehow missed the point it s apparently too much to ask of an alleged black comedy to have some er comedy in it and the argument that it must be good because book club was doesn t wash either if anything this debacle of a film has shown up griffin s remarkable paucity of talent get real i thought this was a great movie for fans of all ages and i think dakota fanning is a sweet girl with an awesome acting future ahead of her i think it was wonderful that they changed the role of the child from a boy to a girl just for her she made this film made it work and made you believe it s a feel good film it teaches patience and perseverance it shows kids and adults alike what can come from hard work i thought it was a very inspiring film made me remember what it was like to be a kid when everything was possible see this movie you won t regret it unless you have a heart of stone it made me treasure the moments between a father and a daughter having lost my dad this year i miss him and i wish we d had a bonding moment like the ones in the film and it was good to see kurt russell again he s always been a favorite of mine and now i can add another movie to my list of all time faves his gal friday is howard hawks tribute to the brilliant play in which this film is based charles mcgraw and ben hecht two of the best writers of the era paid tribute to the journalists that wrote for the american newspapers of the thirties this movie has some of the fastest dialogs in memory the incredible combination of cary grant rosalind russell and ralph bellamy in the main roles is what made this movie a favorite mr grant as walter burns the unscrupulous newspaper editor is the perfect foil for rosalind russell s hildy johnson a role that is played by a male in the original play and in the other film versions the best moment of the film is the moment when cary grant speaking so fast that some what he says goes over the viewer s heads refers as to ralph bellamy by name as not having a chance and cites in the same breadth his real name archibald leach it s hard to imagine anyone but cary grant and rosalind russell playing walter and hildy ralph bellamy is perfect as hildy s fianc bruce baldwin gene lockhart is perfect as the sheriff pinky hartwell the ensemble of actors that play the reporters following the possible execution of earl williams are perfect an excellent comedy thanks to the genius of howard hawks renoir s tale of paris the cancan a washer girl and the moulin rouge a more subdued but highly entertaining version of the opening of the moulin rouge jean gabin gives his usual excellent performance the technicolor photography on the print i saw was exquisite an easy evening s viewing chris w galla i am surprised that so many viewers liked this movie let me make myself clear i find the subject matter very interesting trying to understand why people especially young people and even more so young girls become terrorists or freedom fighters the terminology is heavily dependent on your alliances is quite noble so i was really eager to see the movie but unfortunately was disappointed beyond the normal expectations what was good about it well the actors were not too bad especially given the fact that they were mostly non professionals that s about it what was bad let s start with the premise a girl freedom fighter terrorist becomes impregnated by a wounded brother in arms while they find themselves hiding from the government troops in a ditch and the latter are still raiding the area might i add are you kidding me i admit i ve never been shot in a battle so i cannot tell what a person would normally do under these circumstances but my wild guess is that having sex with a comrade while the enemy soldiers are searching around would not be the first item on the list well may be i am wrong here next who was in charge of the soundtrack and sound in general this was probably the worst movie sound i ve ever heard the same bad composition played on a cheap synthesizer over and over so by the middle of the movie you have an urge to turn the sound off and just read the subtitles who was the director almost every scene with exception of the scenes involving the old man his goofy friend and the paralyzed wife looked exceptionally fake fights killings pull ups etc anyways this could ve been a decent unprofessional movie but for a professional motion picture especially given the amount of positive coverage it falls quite short i just finished watching the dvd of this first class semi screwball comedy in columbia classics beautiful transfer and it absolutely made my day what a movie what a screenplay the dialogue is better more modern in fact than a in lot of contemporary movies it s incredibly funny too and my teenage sons kept laughing right along with me at the smart come backs cary grant is of course as good if not better than ever and i ve never seen rosalind russel in a role that suited her more perfectly and that s just for starters the timing of the thing is still awe inspiring after sixty odd years the supporting actors down to the bit players are all memorable convincing and hilarious the camera work this is the forties though is inventive and the editing superb i can safely confess now that i hadn t ever seen it before but that s no reason for you to make the same mistake go buy rent it now hats off to the great howard hawks his cast and crew for pulling this comedy masterpiece off and thank you thank you thank you columbia pictures formaking it possible for me to watch it in such pristine condition i ve got the edition and from what i ve heard you should beware of earlier dvd issues i can truly say this is one of the greatest movies i have seen in a long time it made me laugh and cry numerous times im not the usual crying type but this movie really moved me i recommend it to everyone this is truly a must see movie for the whole family to enjoy or for a romantic time with your spouse director frank tashlin stretches his anything for a laugh method of comic film making to the breaking point with this very weak advertising send up with equally dull romantic confusion underpinnings tony randall seems the wrong actor for the part of struggling ad rep rockwell hunter who gets a buxom beauty queen to shill for a new lipstick but at a price it s supposed to be a riot but tashlin who also adapted the script from george axelrod s play can t seem to bring the material both farcial and cynical into a cohesive whole it s full of prankish jokes and questionable taste but the episodic results are loud and forced instead of funny there s a satirical promising opening sequence brightly prodding the tv commercials of the era but the movie steadily loses steam from there from a young woman who is a practicing satanist sets out to unearth the tomb of countess bathory by sacrificing young virginal women waldemar daninsky paul naschy also used to be countess bathory s loyal servant when they were executed several hundred years earlier for their gruesome crimes waldemar is now on a mission to destroy countess bathory in order to prevent her from making him her slave once again the craving when it was released in the states was horribly butchered because of its violent content unfortunately this was its biggest detriment it barely made any sense and was quite difficult to keep track of what was going on however i must say the climatic battle between daninsky and bathory was quite exciting and hilarious to watch any paul naschy fan should check out fortunately it was re released under its uncut form via bci deimos a year or two back just please avoid the censored version it s way too confusing this movie has a great soundtrack the title song is pretty but the others used are outstanding california which we hear whenever the hero goes after his old flame should be adopted by the state our hero is a top jingle writer for ad campaigns in new york with a desire to move up to movie scoring this takes him to california which is where the college sweetheart who walked out on him now lives he wants to relive the past with a happy ending this movie will resonate with anyone who has old memories there are especially nice touches here about male friendship and intercommitment james brooks seems to have done everything story music directing lead role and it does seem very personal but this movie has a number of interesting elements in it some bits about working with advertisers to produce a musical spot are marvelous jimmy breslin has an interesting side role there is a lot of warmth to this movie and don t forget the wonderful music although cary grant is justifiably remembered as a screen legend indeed he was probably the most adept of any of his contemporaries at romantic comedy it seems criminal that irene dunne is almost forgotten these days this is the second and most lightweight of three very fruitful screen pairings they had during this period the other two are the even more insane divorce farce the awful truth from and s child adoption tearjerker penny serenade with her insinuating laugh and sophisticated but down to earth manner she is a wonderful screwball heroine even if she lacks the haughty glamour of katharine hepburn or the brazen beauty of carole lombard here dunne plays ellen wagstaff arden returning home after seven years shipwrecked on a desert island the problem is that her husband nick has just gotten remarried to a high maintenance socialite named bianca further complications ensue when it s disclosed that ellen was not alone on the island and that her companion was an athletic adonis named stephen burkett of course a bachelor the ending is obvious from the beginning but there are some hilarious set pieces along the way in particular when ellen recruits a timid shoe salesman to impersonate stephen and also when her ruse is exposed as the real stephen pops up from the country club swimming pool in the same year he made classics like the philadelphia story and his girl friday grant is at the top of his game and dunne matches him every step of the way it does seem a bit of a stretch to think that the principal characters would be celibate for seven long years but such was s hollywood convention randolph scott gamely plays the dumb as dirt stephen an ironic choice given the rumors of the actor s relationship with grant as bianca the glamorously venomous gail patrick expert at such roles from classics like my man godfrey and stage door knows her fate in the movie but doesn t really show her talons until the courtroom scene in scene stealing bits are granville bates as the frustrated judge and donald macbride as the confused hotel clerk the only drawbacks are the overly precocious children played hammily by scotty beckett and mary lou harrington directed with comic mastery by leo mccarey it s a frothy confection from a bygone era and the far inferior doris day remake only proves how unmatchable grant and dunne are the dvd has a surprisingly pristine print transfer and extras include an unrelated comic short featuring humorist robert bentley and a condensed broadcast of the movie featuring grant and dunne you really would think that no other film musical documentary could possibly top that s entertainment come on it s got personal appearances by a host of stars and some of the most famous and best loved clips ever including you know the singing in the rain bit from singin in the rain could it get any better well that s entertainment ii certainly tries its darned hardest to be better not a single clip is repeated from the first film in the trilogy and watching this film really makes you realise just how much talent was all focused in the one studio from the s through to the s judy garland admiring fred astaire s easter bonnet in easter parade garland and astaire sailing up the avenue as a couple of swells in the same film gene kelly and garland dueting on for me and my gal ann miller and bob fosse in kiss me kate a montage of musicals before colour a garland tribute a spencer tracy katharine hepburn love fest this film unabashedly brings them all and much much more together there are a couple of clunkers of course like bobby van hopping like a maniacal rabbit freak through the town or the token esther williams number but as you listen to garland sing have yourself a merry little christmas or frank sinatra croon his way through i fall in love too easily and see gene tap dance on skates as naturally as if he had been born with them strapped on again you re struck with just how special an era this was in film making one that unfortunately is lost to the rest of us except through video and dvd and i know that this isn t the most popular of opinions but i think that s entertainment ii not only matches but far surpasses the original there was nothing special about the first film its only gimmick was the coup it had managed in bringing all these glorious film legends back together to talk about their work the only caveat was that the incredible personalities behind the stars just couldn t shine through except with some pretty special people otherwise they were all reading off a pre written script kind of dampening really that s entertainment ii on the other hand is a small but successful exercise in creativity from the title sequence through to gene kelly s direction of the new footage between himself and astaire it s also a delight for fans of both astaire and kelly when these two dancing men you know dance together again sure they re not as nimble and quicksilver as they used to be and some of the lyrics they re singing are well the only word for it is corny but there s no denying that both these men have a kind of screen charisma that doesn t disappear with time and having them both onscreen together singing now that really is entertainment as it should be in the final scene they tell us that the best films have the audience leaving the film with a glow how right they are quite simply that s entertainment ii is sheer perfect nostalgia bottled and kept simmering just waiting for an audience about the only flaw with it is that it simply couldn t be better than its source material but that s also what s so good about this film it makes you want to go out and rent all the others and still watch it over again just to revel in astaire and kelly being onscreen together for the first time since the babbitt and the bromide in ziegfeld follies almost three decades ago what more could you ask for i saw this one when i was in high school i had been warned ahead of time but i liked classical music including grieg and ignored the warnings i remember several things about it that really sum the film up in my opinion the photography was stunning snow fjords and norwegian towns and scenery were really pretty as were the folk costumes grieg s music was nice to listen to though as in all films about composers they only give samplings those are the good parts the bad parts were what sank the boat there wasn t much of a story greig s life wasn t as exciting as many other composers lives and a lot was padded to keep the story going for or hours i remember a lot of overacting as well but the worst part of all was the directing forever emblazoned upon my memory is the hideously clich d scene where grieg his wife and someone else spread their arms and run across a green field stop on a hillock and spin around to face the audience then they do the same thing again and again if that s not enough to make you give up then nothing is before i saw this film i read an interview with donnie yen where he said that he puts his blood and passion into everyshot i think he was indeed very passionate about this film while i don t think it is perfect it is a great stylished modern gun fu action film hardcore action fans maybe bummed about the pace i think it is just right the improvement from donnie s first two films is right on the screen i do think his other films are good don t get me wrong having recently seen princess blade on the big screen i think what i like about donnie yen s fight scenes is they are very much a part of the film the fights come from a balenced sense of cinema and kung fu miramax needs to give donnie the budget and put him behind the camera on a high brow iron monkey watching blasstic kiss should give them faith this surprisingly primitive streamliner comedy from the roach studios with the collapse of the comedy short subject market in the mid thirties hal roach decided to go into feature production first with films like the topper series and later with second features that timed in at less than an hour contains all the standard cheap comedy motifs including a murphy bed and runs through them in a rather mechanical fashion as made it from scratch taxi fleet owners william bendix and joe sawyer get tangled up with a girl who tries to kill herself and declares herself their responsibility the dialogue direction limps and although there are some good gags in the opening scenes including a music hating music critic and jack norton playing his usual fine comic drunk there isn t that much in the way of laughs to recommend this piece this rather dark film noir with its uneasy comics roscoe ates nana bryant and billy house who even repeats his checkers trick from the stranger and desperate heroine mary beth hughes is further strengthened by the forceful performance of charles russell who manages to make his rather ambivalent drifter somewhat sympathetic admittedly he is helped in this goal by the obnoxious loudmouth and light on brains mike who whether by accident or design is made even more repulsive than the screenplay requires by the over enthusiastic acting of dale belding fortunately when the script gives her a chance mary beth hughes comes to the rescue with her animated portrait of the girl who wants to escape her small town prison in keeping with the nocturnal atmosphere of the radio series most of the action takes place at night however although the picture is big on atmosphere despite its obviously limited budget it is somewhat deficient in characterization and motivation the screenplay overstates the one dimensional comic interludes but dwells little on the forces that drive the main characters why does russell murder the girl is it an accident self defense the script hints at these factors but why hint and what is the background to this meeting so many questions remain unanswered this movie isn t that great at all but it s good when you want to just laugh because it s pretty ridiculous there are a lot of mistakes in it and it s cheesy i got this movie for christmas like years ago but for some reason i ve never given it away i guess i just like it for a rainy day even though i only watch it like once a year this is a very s movie so it s really funny to see how everyone dresses and acts this movie is good for someone young although come to think of it i didn t even like it much when i was like but that s just my personal opinion the movie was really predictable i wish it had had some extra weird twists but i guess it was trying to be an appropriate movie for everyone to enjoy i think it was appropriate for the whole family but hallie s dress was a bit unmodest but certainly appropriate enough for family material well it s friday the th and by the remake is so retarded jason is back but he s retarded i m so sorry all of you jason fans but this just disappoints my butt the only thing that friday the th part deserved in media is a video game yes a video game now friday the th is classical s series in a creepy sorted of way now other series in the s like batman halloween and nightmare on elm stereet are s that don t lie i kind of enjoyed the new halloween derectied by rob zombie but this is baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad hahaahahahahahah next review superman returns sigend the angry video game nerd i m not sure how to describe this bizarre but beautiful movie first it s long just one minute under three hours and it s not exactly fast paced either if sci fi for you means action spaceships and interplanetary intrigue give this one a miss in fact although the cover describes it as the cult bbc science fiction film i d hesitate to call it science fiction indeed i d hesitate to label it anything at all and it s definitely flawed the dialogue is riddled with melodrama and pretentious poetry the camera work sophomoric and the editing clumsy and yet the effect shines through the movie has an eerie otherworldly quality where trivial details such as an old lady glaring at a noisy conversation in a library seem to take on ominous significance and so if you have the patience you ll get sucked in to this movie it s mysterious and beautiful but don t expect to come out satisfied although there is a plot it is far from clear the story moves from one surreal incident to another each connected but seldom shedding any light on its predecessor even at the end when it appears that our protagonists have triumphed it s far from clear what exactly they ve triumphed over and most loose ends are left firmly untied hywel bennett does a fine job as as the somewhat petulant author caught up in a situation that might have been co written by kafka and philip k dick dinah stabb perhaps succumbs a little to her melodramatic script dan o herlihy brings an artistic gravitas to his role a cameo from a very young daniel day lewis and a supporting role by sting add a bit of celebrity interest overall artemis reminded me more than anything of twin peaks which was made nearly a decade later and curiously also featured dan o herlihy the same sense of explanation hidden just around the corner and another reality just half glimpsed and poorly understood i don t think everyone will enjoy this movie but i certainly did director star orson welles also adapted isak dinesen s rather pointless book about an aged millionaire recluse living in china who tells his employee of an incredible story he heard while in the service regarding a rich dying man his terrible wife and a sailor stud the employee explains that this tale is just a legend but the millionaire aims to make it fact the sexual implications in the narrative aren t ignored by welles though they are tip toed around probably due to the restrictions of and when welles as the old gentleman finds himself the perfect boy to complete his plan it s hard not to smirk when he calls the bottle blonde a fine looking sailor and then offers him money who needs jeanne moreau when these two are hitting it off so well from this is probably jean claude van damme at his sexiest the best thing is that he s a prisoner and there s no suggestion that he was wrongfully imprisoned he starts off as a bad boy but of course his tough exterior melts away to reveal his inner sentimentality when he meets a widow and her two children one of which is played by one of those hideous culkins this is the first movie which is rayesque to the core one of his most obvious permanent feature really appears for the first time the search for a father the relationship bogart derek is intense after the death of the biological one and predates those of run for cover john derek again playing opposite cagney and rebel without a cause remember plato to jim and judy i wish you could be my parents but i could also mention the mitchum kennedy relationship in lusty men or even heston and the chinese girl in days at peking or james mason and his biological this time in bigger than life emma s character predates the rayesque young girl the one you meet again in they live by night note how allene roberts resembles cathy o donnell allene roberts beaming face and her hope against hope are the only ray of light in a dark tragical story like fritz lang nicholas ray put the blame on the society nick was born under a bad sign like many of the director s heroes john derek gives an intense performance climaxing in the scene in the court when his wife s suicide is revealed bogart shines as his lawyer he s more convincing in this kind of part than he was in marked woman excellent screenplay with a superb editing many contemporary movies such as the brilliant usual suspects might have been influenced by the first scenes note that the story begins during the cast and credits which shows that ray when he was on top of his game did not know filler this was a poor movie with jack nicholson he is one on my favorite actors jack accepting to do a movie like this is a real dissapointment why did he do it a sharper script would have helped a lot the story line was very weak this movie is good but disappointingly is nowhere near as good as the first airbud the storyline is predictable and cheesey and you don t even see much of josh framm s legs the hot teenage kevin zegers is the best thing in this movie michael aged red corner was not only a good movie it kept me emotionally engaged for the entire film i expected richard gere to do a good job he always does but bai ling stole the movie with a touching performance red corner is very well directed too but from jon avnet who would expect anything else producer jonathan shields is in big trouble on a production and reaches out to three people he s befriended and betrayed in the past for help all three are brought to harry pebbel s office where he makes a pitch for the help of each one and we re told in flashback the dynamics of the relationships between shields and each one one thing about tinseltown they ve never been afraid to show the seamier side of movie making kirk douglas s jonathan shields is a not too thinly disguised version of david o selznick the same drive the same ambition the same overwhelming ego that selznick was legendary for is a part that was tailor made for kirk douglas the three betrayed people director fred amiel barry sullivan star georgia lorrison lana turner and screenwriter james lee barlow dick powell all ring very true one of the things i like about this film is that all three stories each in itself could be expanded into a film all it s own lana turner s role as the ersatz diana barrymore is not to hard to spot either it s so much better here than the film based on her own book too much too soon if that voice of turner s actor father on those rpms she s playing sounds familiar it s that of louis calhern turner s was a life lived out all too well in the tabloids and she brings all of it to bear in playing gerogia lorrison dick powell who was offered the lead as jonathan shields opted to play tweedy professor turned screenwriter james lee barlow this was powell s next to last feature picture as an actor it should have been the one he went out on powell was always ahead of the industry s cutting edge and he decided to concentrate more on directing and acting for the small screen powell s segment includes gloria grahame as his flirty wife post world war ii hollywood whenever it had a part for a tramp first call gloria grahame here she responds with an academy award winning performance she hasn t many scenes but as was said in another mgm picture around that time what there is is cherce i don t think there s ever been an actor who can go from zero to sixty on the emotional scale as quickly as kirk douglas check the scene when lana turner discovers how douglas betrayed her the intensity of his reaction alone is frightening and real douglas was also up for an oscar but it went that year to laconic gary cooper in high noon vincente minelli put all the pieces together just right and it comes out great entertainment i made the mistake of renting this on pay per view while i was alone one night the feeding might have been bearable with a crowd to make fun of it with but flying solo it was just excruciating in addition to being dreadfully acted the characters and the script is simply imbecilic i was especially irritated because the dumbest most volatile fool of the bunch the one who s stupid actions get i lost track of just how many people killed survives in the end there are maybe one or two decent gore effects but overall they re as bad as everything else oh and the monster suit wouldn t scare a kitten but the nude scenes might yikes warning spoiler content this movie is excellent right from the start it is clever quirky slick and really really funny also to the trained eye it is packed full of so much symbolism that there is almost no scene where one cannot be found the characters are clever and represented wonderfully by the people who play them especially rabbit you have to love that guy even if you find him a constant irritation the film would definitely not be complete without him the storyline is nice well thought out and spreads the action out nicely over the length of the film providing us the audience with a good dose of revenge humour irritation entertainment maybe even a little fear for the weak hearted and squeamish watchers and finally and a little unexpectedly the iron man la rocha having a sentimental moment at the end with his father the only thing that stopped this movie getting ten out of ten for me was the female lead she is a great actress and fit into the part really well i just find that her voice offends my hearing to such a degree that i can hardly bear to listen it really grates against the ears other than that this is an amazing film i would recommend it to anyone looking for something that is not particularly scary but nonetheless highly entertaining decades ago a crate filled with weapons grade plutonium crashes on an island and soaks into the ground today a team of military men are sent to track down a notorious terrorist of ambiguous national origin and they track him to this polluted island when their raft is destroyed the team must spend the night on shore but soon discover that the plutonium has done something awful to the island it has called forth hundreds of bloodthirsty velociraptors let me start this with a lesson don t lend a movie to your friend before you ve seen it especially if you are supposed to be reviewing it for the internet s finest horror movie site it took me almost a year to get this film back and the person who borrowed it still had not watched it though we ended up seeing it together and a second more important lesson when you do watch this keep your expectations as low as humanly possible because this film ranks among the worst i ve ever seen my acting in th grade was more convincing than the seasoned actors who appear in this film lorenzo lamas stephen bauer line delivery is very fake and the words themselves are poorly scripted the opening words come from a man checking out his gun s scope boom dead bad guys yes that s pure genius at work the only conversation with any depth has two main characters explaining their histories but it too seems unnatural and a poor attempt to provide character background and to fill time we didn t need to know anything about their histories so why bore us with it and if you think the conversations are bad you ain t seen nothing yet the lighting is atrocious i generally don t notice lighting but my friend a former film school student was practically vomiting in rage at the way more often than not shadows fell on the actors faces and the light would be in the background focused on nothing in particular most lighting looks like a spotlight in a dim room and many of the scenes involve a deep subterranean cavern which you d then expect to be poorly lit but had lights coming from all sorts of random angles don t ask me why the plot was pretty bad some films can take the idea of military men chasing a terrorist and make a convincing film out of it cat and mouse stories are riveting well not here the terrorist is really not even part of the story just an excuse to go to the island and the raptors and the allosaurus sure they came from the plutonium that soaked into the ground but if that makes sense to you please explain it to me because i have no clue how radiation brings dinosaurs back from millions of years of extinction by far the worst part of raptor island is the animation of the raptors that s right the selling point of the film is the worst aspect the animation isn t just bad it s subpar i can t even express the hilarity of cartoons this cheesy and when they get shot red splats like one would see in an old video game even the airplane helicopter and navy ship are cartoons how hard is it to get a model plane please don t see raptor island unless you need a good laugh or want to get sickeningly drunk sure you probably want to see it before you see raptor island which seems to be getting better reviews but just avoiding it entirely is your best bet the closest thing i can compare it to is pinata survival island and unfortunately this film makes the pinata look good by comparison you have been warned hitchcock comparisons abound with chabrol however you may be hard pressed to see anything other than a superficial similarity between them here although nicely acted and crafted le boucher has a curious sense of disengagement that will either fascinate or frustrate viewers while not necessarily a bad thing in itself this can also give the impression of a lack of depth it s hard to fully discern what the character motivations are so depending on your proclivity you are likely to become either enthralled or disinterested in what they might actually be viewers familiar with francois truffaut will notice some similarities in approach but chabrol lacks the concise poetry of that other french great even though the opening wedding sequence nicely sets up a scene of normality for the events that follow it s rather overlong and a more hitchcockian terseness would certainly have helped still the film does have a strange charm and there are some excellent character ideas regarding the schoolteacher content with her celibacy long after a bad relationship being seduced threatened by the promise of new love from the local butcher who may or may not be a murderer these threads are either unexplored or deliberately withheld depending on your point of view a worthwhile watch for those interested but possibly not quite the masterpiece some might lead you to believe it is the rise and fall of comic lenny bruce dustin hoffman bruce was one of the first comedians to use swearing in his act and was actually taken to court over it the movie also chronicles his marriage to stripper honey harlow valerie perrine bob fosse was a strange choice to direct this he had only done two musicals before sweet charity and cabarat but cabaret was such a huge hit i guess he could pick and choose what he wanted he shoots it in black and white and uses a documentary style approach by interviewing bruces wife mother and agent and then flashing to those scenes it does work but the film is extremely depressing the black and white is very stark and gives the film a cold look and feeling also i found nothing funny in hoffman doing bruce s routines it s not that he s bad he s actually very good but the tone of the film is not humorous as i said hoffman is good but perrine is spectacular she gives a very strong nuanced performance also she does an extremely erotic strip tease at the beginning of the film and holds her own in a mild lesbian scene it s worth catching but you ll probably be depressed by the end if this film weren t such a downer it would probably be better known in his life the john lennon story was a great movie but it could have been a little bit better i was really impressed with how accurate it was i thought it was a good drama of the beginning of the beatles however the movie was supposed to be a john lennon story not the story of the beatles all this movie was was a quick story of how paul met john how john grew up la dee dah don t get me wrong i thought it was absolutely wonderful that they actually showed all these important events in john s life but they didn t outline any of his later years i suppose the directors of this movie wanted to do something a little bit different then the s john and yoko a love story besides that minor detail i loved this movie i thought it was well acted out a treat to all audiences it was on the nose accurate and the actors who performed in it were absolutely wonderful it almost made me feel like i was watching the real beatles neon maniacs great movie by far one of my top greatest films the movie is so great because of the great original plot and characters have u ever seen a movie when maniacs are killed by water no then check this out i love alot of movies this definetly is one of them and its also hard to get so if u ever find it get it because even if u didnt like it its one of those movies when u cant not see it and u have to judge yourself reasons jason goes to hell is the worst in a pretty good series of slasher films jason is not scary when he s on american casefiles i think that s what the america s most wanted like tv show was called the whole reason he was scary was because he was this backwoods crazy type of character that was based soley in legend and newspaper writings putting him on tv sucks so does having the fbi go after him he looks stupid in this one that skin bubbling over the hockey mask is just dumb they try to put too much plot in it come on it s a friday the th movie isn t it forget this body hopping and hellbaby garbage and get the hell back in the woods jason i thought i had written a review of this travesty of a movie there was absolutely nothing worthwhile in it i agree with the last reviewer its too much nose candy they use a hand held camera to the extreme i have seen better hand held camera work on youtube the acting is second rate by a well known cast i will not insult them by naming them same for the director writer this was filmed on the beautiful cayman islands it should have been done on the santa monica beach that is how much it looked like the caymans rating out of points out of imdb out of steven seagal returns in black dawn cool title i cannot say the same for the movie though it ranks as the worst seagal movie yet yes it is worse than out for a kill did we really need a sequel to the forigner that bad steven returns as jonathon cold assassin for hire this time he is out to stop a group of terrorists and prevent nuclier bomb from hitting los angelas with the help of cia agent tamara davies this idea seems okay the jonathon cold character once again gives the big guy a chance to tarnish his clean cut cinematic image you get the feeling with a decent director and production team this movie could have went somewhere if this cost million i wanna know where it was spent it was not spent on the movie the action scenes are not bad the movie was obviously shot like a doug liman flick its just that most of the time seagal is doubled so much you cannot take the movie seriously whatsoever the script seems what script logic is black dawned for a dozen low budget action movies seagal is not too bad here for a whole minutes he is engaging then goes about the sleepwalking that he has done for his last movies whoever is doing his fighting is doing a commendable job the light that shines through is tamara davies as cold s sidekick she has the chops skills looks and drive that give black dawn a little kick in the action department how she got in this movie is a riddle she should be a bigger star nicholas davidoff and john pyper feruson are not believable bad guys whose idea was it to make a sequel to a bad movie in the first place it did not set the world on fire to my memory i can only hope they inject the next forigner sequel with some class imagination less stunt doubles and a livelier seagal if not then leave jonathon cold on ice in what is said to be his landmark film buster keaton plays johnnie gray a train engineer in tennessee in when war breaks out he decides to enlist but is turned down because he is more valuable as an engineer his girlfriend s father and brother believe him to be too afraid to enlist and his girlfriend refuses to speak to him until he is in uniform a year later gray is engineering his train the general which is then stolen by northern spies and used to halt supplies to the south gray pursues the train by handcar bicycle and engine car then after rescuing his girlfriend who was on the train the tables are reversed as the spies chase him gray on the general pretty innovative comedy with great stuntwork by keaton including knocking away the railroad tie with another and a good feeling all around keaton turns in an absolutely great performance with a great showing of slapstick sympathy and and romance rating robert harling took the liberties of directing this very good but sometimes misunderstood follow up to the classic shirley maclaine reprises her role as aurora and in my view is just as good and sometimes better in this performance then she was in the first movie juliette lewis takes the role of melanie and in my opinion i thought she played the best character next to aurora because we have to remember that melanie is the only child that has never really known her mother so you can automatically feel the pain of the character george newborn plays tommy and the character of tommy is in prison for what we don t really know mackenzie astin plays teddy and is really the only child that is slightly happy and normal of the three this is years after the first and the storyline is pretty much that amount of time later maybe a little more because melanie is pretty much grown up as well it goes through what each of emma s kids have been through in those years and where they ended up aurora s stress level with these kids is a record high she has one in jail one is pretty much a teenager who hates her guts and one is doing slightly well for himself but that doesn t help with the other two lol i also loved the story with aurora and rosie i thought that was beautiful because even though rosie was the maid her and aurora were like family and when aurora was carrying rosie in the rain to take her home for the final moments of her life that was truly beautiful the story lines with jerry bill paxton and patsy miranda richardson is just purely for entertainment and laughter i especially like the airplane fight people are mixed reviewed on that fight but i laughed so hard but the emotion of the film like aurora making the photo albums her spreading rosie s ashes on the beach my favorite jack nicholson also makes a nice appearance and finally aurora s death all of these elements make for a great movie and succeed people who write bad reviews or even mixed reviews probably don t understand the story good enough this sequel was really not meant to be an exact copy of what the original was years before this which is why i think people looked at it differently this is also why it went under a different name because it was the same characters but a completely different plot and story overall a movie that should be given more credit because it is just as good as the original well by camera work i really mean all visual effects as well as the cinematography set design it s a visual treat the effects used to dramatize bob mcconnell s sense of isolation and loneliness were intriguing also great acting by mr slater as usual i like this guy s work it s nice to see william macy in a different type of role than i usually see him in but anyone could have done that turn not much there for him to do but he ably supports which is a fine thing since that s what his role here should be in some ways it reminded me of fight club saw this on an airplane today and now i m kicking back and looking it up i quite enjoyed it it s hard to put into words just how bad the acting is in this movie i won t even get into the ridiculous psuedo plot because i can t get past the acting i ve seen more talent in a play put on by kindergarteners and cats watch this film if you ve been really bad and your priest is not available for confession this is good for about a thousand hail marys i completely understand the plot it goes like this girl without memory has face changed for some reason the police changed her memory she changed her face because she did a drug rip deal here brother likes to kill people who look like her actually she is a turkish terrorist jean reno is involved in something the turks kill another group of turks in a bath filled with mintthen it gets better the girl is a ninja the drugs are in an enormous cave filled with death people the case collapses and reno is death no he is not deathnever mind all that the end is amazing reno the cop the girl the brother all end up in turkey at the same time of course the whole france police force is also there the girl kills here father the cop reno and the police kill everyone else in the village the serial killer brother tries to serial kill the girlthe best thing about this movie however is the final end switch of dvd player throw disk in bin and sue the french for wasting your time movie seem to be made by a bunch of spaced out french with a high budget awful just awful worst waste of time and money ever well there s french cars which are a step below that charlie mackenzie myers is a san francisco coffee house poet whose poems are about all of his failed relationships with women and he s scared of commitment things change when charlie meets harriet michaels travis a local butcher who isn t just beautiful but has a heart of gold their relationship is going great until he suspects harriet of being mrs x a woman who kills her husbands on their wedding night his friend tony lapaglia thinks he s just being paranoid but the story reaches a climax when the real murderer is revealed and tries to kill charlie the cast includes brenda fricker amanda plummer alan arkin and a cameo appearance by charles grodin so i married an axe murderer is one of the funniest yet scary romantic comedies of mike myers also plays the role of stuart mackenzie charlie s father stars sometimes you come across movies that are so bad and so full of overacting and mistakes they actually become hilarity this is one of them i can live with the based on bit but i never knew it was the irish who were fed to a bull like monster that failed to scare even my year old son by some drug crazed nubians i had greek mythologies back at school and although i do not remember much of it this was not part of the minotaur story none the less never laughed so hard since bridget jones any good comment you think sure i liked the decors the costumes and basically the entire movie it just parts ways with the original story and goes more the aliens predator tremors etc tour thanks any way this episode is the best i ve seen of this show it s so creepy i love it when i watched it i was terrified and shaking all over i was like feel his pulse feel his pulse can t you see he s alive and when they brought him to the morgue i was like oh my god they re gonna bury him alive it was almost out of my worst nightmare i was so relieved when he started crying and the people noticed my brother thought the episode was utterly boring how could it be boring my hart still starts thumping when i think about the episode hichcock was so good i haven t seen any of his movies yet except half of rear window in school but i ll watch the birds this weekend i m sure it s great beauty and the beast tells the story of belle an unusual but beautiful girl who goes in search of her inventor father and comes across a mysterious castle she enters the castle in search of her father to discover it is occupied by a beast she becomes his prisoner the beast is loveless and thankless but she soon begins to fall in love with him and he with her the film s end is happy satisfying and inspiring showing what the power of love can do beauty and the beast is a charming story of love and magic it features lovely music songs like beauty and the beast be our guest and belle are catchy and fun to listen to it features first class characters the quirky belle gaston the hateful attractive villain the beast a character one can t help but feels sorry for the enchanted objects mrs potts cogsworth and lumiere characters that bring a lighthearted quality to the movie beauty and the beast also features excellent executed animation it isn t hard to tell all the talent the sweat and the heart that was put in this film the ballroom sequence and the sequence that shows when the beast becomes human are among the most outstanding animated sequences in recent cinema beauty and the beast is great in another aspect it s ageless although it appears to be a children oriented film it doesn t take much for an adult to find it extraordinarily appealing it s a fabulous film for the whole family to watch and enjoy when i first saw beauty and the beast i fell in love with it it s a beautiful tale an engaging musical and wonderful fable of romance one of the greatest examples of traditional animation in recent years it will go down in history with other beautiful disney masterpieces like snow white and the seven dwarfs fantasia and cinderella
